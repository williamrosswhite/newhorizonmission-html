    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        <p>I grew up here in the lower mainland, first in Richmond, and then in the Surrey/Delta area.
            I then spent a decade or so in the Okanagan, where I obained a bachelor's degree in psychology with a
            minor in philosophy. Following this I spent several years writing science fiction books, and then later
            got into the CST program at BCIT.
        </p>
        <p>I've always been a big techie; I've always been interested in hardware and how things work.
            I've always enjoyed using cool technology, as well as curiuos about what goes on under the hood, and what
            makes it all go. Going to BCIT for software development was a bit of a gamble, but it's paying off. I think
            I've taken to it very well though. I really enjoy the work and am find the content compelling. I'm quite
            eager to graduate and get out in the field!</p>
        <p>More personally, I love academics and learning all I can, I have an 800 hour
            backlog podcast playlist, I enjoy running and would like to run a marathon some day. I enjoy video
            games, a Nintendo boy for life but I love my PS4 too. I love science fiction and comedy, especially put
            together! Good compelling drama is wonderful as well of course.
