            I almost died that day… Well, not really. Actually, overall it went about
            as well as anyone could have hoped for, if it had to happen at all.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The Coquihalla highway was closed due to severe avalanche risk so Greyhound
            had been taking the longer but very scenic Hope-Princeton Highway to
            Kelowna. The extra time it took created a passenger backlog though, and by
            the time of my scheduled trip, they’d had to charter a second bus.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I made the mistake of choosing to ride on the charter bus because it was
            supposed to arrive earlier than the regular bus since it wasn’t making most
            of the stops along the way. Since I’d loaded up with snacks and drinks
            ahead of time, fewer stops wouldn’t be a problem for me.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Once in the snowy mountains, we were coming around a bend, and a semi-truck
            travelling in the opposite direction came over the centre line, and forced
            our driver to veer to the right to avoid a collision, and we wound up in
            the ditch. As we ran over the rumble strips at the side of the road and
            started going over, I thought: ‘oh, okay… well THIS is happening.’
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We landed on a 45 degree angle, with me on the high side and sitting on the
            arm rest. A number of bags had flown out of overhead compartments and one
            wanged a woman on the head pretty good. ‘Ok,’ I thought, ‘well THAT just
            happened.’ I resigned myself to the reality that my day was ruined.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We were on the outside of a bend in the road on a wide curve to the right,
            and we’d gone into the ditch at the base of a tall hill. The scariest parts
            were the cars and trucks coming up over the hill ahead of us, and finding
            it very difficult to stop. We watched several near misses until a different
            semi-truck stopped beside us and offered to help. Before cluing in to using
            road salt and tire chains, he very nearly slid into us as he tried to get
            moving again. Even with chains his tires idly spun around and around as he
            inched over the next hill. People who stopped to help were sent on their
            way to call in the accident when they could since we had no cellular
            signal.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Our driver tried backing up onto the road again which worried me, since all
            that was behind us was oncoming traffic blindly coming around the bend. He
            only succeeded in backing up in the ditch and created a bus shaped trench
            ahead of us.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We’d effectively rolled over onto our exit door. We could have broken a
            window, but then we’d be exposed to the cold. Instead we stayed inside
            risking carbon monoxide poisoning as the bus kept us warm by idling and
            exhausting into the solid snow bank behind us. Aside from the smokers it
            was remarkable how calm we all were. Yes we went off the road, but we’d
            landed on a large snow pillow and nobody had been seriously hurt. If it had
            to happen at all, it really couldn’t have gone any better.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Around this time a Shriner hospital bus happened by, and the driver offered
            us a lift since he was empty and already headed that way. It was such a
            kind offer; I have no idea how we would have carried on once we were
            rescued if that bus hadn’t stopped and offered to help us.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When the first paramedic arrived, the brown haired woman squeezed her way
            through the pinned front door while joking about how she shouldn’t have had
            that ice cream earlier. She assessed the woman who’d been hit on the head
            and a couple others who had concerns. Not long after the ambulance showed
            up, so did everyone else. One of the good natured rescue guys came onboard
            to figure out how they were going to get us out, and when someone
            complimented him on his solo mustache, which he proudly proclaimed “oh
            yeah, 70s porn ‘stache.”
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            It had now been two hours since the crash, and it was dark outside. They
            decided they were going to break the already cracked right front window and
            file us out through it. They easily smashed the window out, removed the
            rubber stripping, and placed a matt over the bottom for us to safely climb
            over onto a step ladder on the outside.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Since I was sitting near the front, I was one of the first out after those
            with medical concerns. After hopping through and having my bag handed to
            me, I thanked the crews profusely, and then climbed out of the bus-shaped
            trench onto the highway. I could see a long snaking line of lights from the
            vehicles stopped behind us. The scene was absorbing, the flashing lights,
            the fresh snow piled a meter high, and a series of people being helped out
            of a bus through a smashed front window were mesmerizing. After a little
            playful sliding on the icy roadway, I helped some of the others transfer
            our baggage from the crashed bus onto the Shriner one.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            My second big mistake of the day, was allowing most of the other passengers
            onto the new bus before me, despite being one of the first off of the last
            bus. I figured there would be as much room on the new bus as there was on
            the old, but I was wrong. After climbing aboard, I made my way past some
            very comfortable looking, but very occupied recliner chairs. Further up the
            aisle were hospital beds with three people sitting on each and as I passed
            them it dawned on me that there was absolutely nowhere for me to sit. I was
            one of the last people on the bus, and there was hardly even any floor left
            for me to sit on.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The best I could do was to find a square half meter of floor for myself
            between the coffee machine above my head, the bathroom ahead of me and its
            door frequently opening into my leg space, and a cabinet latch digging into
            my back. Not long after I’d resigned myself to this bitter situation, an
            endless parade of inconsiderates stepped in my space to help themselves to
            the expensive single cup coffee maker and bottled water over my head. The
            kindness of the bus driver giving us a ride, was being repaid with theft.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Twenty minutes after finally getting underway again, we were stopped for
            another two hours due to yet another accident further up the road. Only now
            did I lose my sense of humour with the situation. So far it was an easily
            bearable interesting adventure, but after we were stopped again for an
            unknown length of time, I was now fully embittered.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When we finally started moving again, after twenty minutes travel, we were
            stopped again for yet another hour. After this, our three hour trip the
            rest of the way to Kelowna continued on uninterrupted.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            At some point, we started getting phone service again, and as I coaxed my
            phone into sending a simple ‘I’m ok’ to Joyce, all at once I received
            increasingly concerned messages from her, ending with a desperate sounding:
            ‘I don’t know what to do…’ It was bittersweet to have someone worry about
            me like that. It was comforting, but at the same time knowing she was
            worrying about me was the worst part of the ordeal since I couldn’t
            reassure her until the phones started working again.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            My next fun adventure was dodging the feet of all the people trying to use
            their phones plugged into a power bar behind the coffee maker over my head,
            which didn’t stop other people from nearly scalding me as they still tried
            to use the coffee machine over my head which was now down to only having
            hot chocolate inserts.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Finally I saw Okanagan Lake, and I knew I was almost home. People cheered
            as we finally pulled into the bus depot eleven hours after leaving
            Vancouver. Some clueless management guy stood at the front of the bus,
            blocking our exit only to offer apologetic platitudes. After everyone who’d
            had comfortable seating got off the bus I was finally able to exit, and I
            rushed through the terminal into a big hug with Joyce.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            In retrospect, what really stands out for me is how well it all went.
            Nobody flipped out or was hurt, and another bus was able to give us a lift.
            Aside from irritation and discomfort on the second bus, the worst part was
            just the hours of my life the incident consumed. I wasn’t left with a fear
            of bus travel; I was just the victim of a statistic; there was nothing I
            should have done to avoid it, and it’s nothing I should ever expect to
            happen again. Like so much of life, it was just some stuff that happened.
