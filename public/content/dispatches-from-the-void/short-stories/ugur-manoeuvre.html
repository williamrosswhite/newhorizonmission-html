        <p class="lead">
            Joyce and I had just gotten into Istanbul that evening, the last stop of
            our guided tour through the Balkans. We spent half of the day just making
            our way through the Istanbul itself through a gridlocked Istanbul Highway
            complete with young men selling roses, bottled water, and headphones as
            they walked between the highway lanes. Being more adventurous than others
            in our tour group who might seek out the safety of the hotel restaurant, we
            went out into the dusk of a fall Istanbul evening to seek out our dinner.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We didn’t stray far from out hotel, but we did walk up and down nearby
            streets seeing what we could see since we would be staying in the area for
            three nights. It’s strange being in a foreign place, and Turkey was
            certainly the most foreign place I’d ever been. In shops and restaurants,
            people inside speak a smattering of English if any at all, and
            communication is frequently a multi-modal struggle, trying to find key
            words we both understand mixed with pointing and other gestures.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We settled on a place called Uğur Usta, and for only one reason; I’d
            recently started watching a man named Cenk Uygur on an internet news show.
            So we went in. We’d actually walked past it earlier and been put off at
            first by a man sitting on a motorcycle and smoking right outside the door,
            but we later figured out he was a delivery guy.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We happened to show up soon after four other people from our tour group,
            and when the man who was serving us understood that we knew each other, he
            began pushing tables together so we could all sit together. Joyce and I had
            been looking forward to a quiet dinner alone after spending so much time
            with our tour group, so with the heat inside the restaurant as our excuse,
            we extricated ourselves from the others as politely as we could and instead
            sat down at the table just outside. It was delightfully cool, and it gave
            us the opportunity to watch the world go by. We were on a narrow street,
            but only a few storefronts down there was a much more interesting larger
            street.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The man serving gave every appearance of being the owner, and I assumed he
            was the Uğur the restaurant was named after. He was a late middle aged man
            with typically swarthy Turkish skin and was bald on the top of his head. He
            seemed to be very friendly, but it was difficult to communicate with him.
            We all made assumptions, claiming to understand what each other were saying
            when we really didn’t. He seemed concerned that we were sitting outside, he
            kept looking up and holding his hand out as though he were concerned we
            would get dripped or rained on. The menu had an English section… sort of,
            and when he first came to serve us we just ordered a couple drinks.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After receiving our drinks, we had to negotiate the menu which was
            challenging, but not impossible since in addition to rough English
            translations it had pictures of the items. Wanting to sample various things
            when so far from home, we each picked two things we wanted to try. When
            Uğur came back we pointed out the items we wanted as we gave mangled
            pronunciation attempts. Uğur moved his hands around in a circle in a
            questioning way and asked “together?” in addition to some other words we
            couldn’t make out. Joyce and I looked at each other and simply agreeably at
            him together. We figured he was asking if we wanted everything at the same
            time as opposed to one after another.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After a short time, Uğur brought us some food which we definitely hadn’t
            ordered. It was something rather like a pita football; it was a large thin
            pita filled with hot air, complete with two kinds of what as a westerner I
            can only describe as salsa, one was some kind of red sauce with fine
            chunks, and the other was some kind of Turkish Greek salad. Joyce and I
            looked at each other somewhat confused. We didn’t know if this was
            something we were to eat with our meal when it came out, or if it was while
            you wait snack. Cautious at first, I ripped off a piece of pita, dipped it
            in the red sauce, and tried it. It was good!
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Uğur then returned and mystified us. He brought out four small glasses, and
            after clearing a large central area on our table, he placed them upside
            down in a square, and put small wet napkins on top of each of them. We
            didn’t know what to make of that, but we were going to go along with it
            whatever came of it. We kept eating the pita and dip, and before we knew it
            we had eaten all of the pita. When he came back and asked if we could have
            another pair of drinks and another pita, he seemed to laugh at us, but
            before long he’d brought our drinks and another inflated pita which we
            tried to eat more slowly.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Then came our next surprise, but at least it answered our previous
            confusion. The glasses were a stand for the large platter he brought us and
            set upon them. We realized then that when he’d asked: “together?” he was
            asking if we wanted it all on one big platter to share. Happy for the
            revelation, we then investigated what we’d gotten. Some of the things we
            recognized as things we had ordered, others things not so much. In
            retrospect, I imagine some of the items were sides for the dishes we’d
            ordered.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            On the platter was kafte, seasoned ground lamb meat on a skewer, more
            recognizable kebabs, an eggplant dish Joyce had ordered, and for some
            reason most memorable for me, some sort of onion salad which is hard to
            describe. It had sliced white onions in a light orangey-red sauce heaped in
            a pile on the platter. Whatever it was it was delicious. So, not sure how
            we had gotten everything we’d ordered, we nevertheless happily ate it, and
            I believe we wound up eating all of it, including a second pita. Not long
            after having brought our food out, Uğur then for some reason brought us
            fresh cutlery, and then proceeded to take one of the eggplants off of the
            platter with Joyce’s utensils, place it on her side plate, and ‘show’ her
            how to cut it and eat it. To this day we still can’t quite figure that one
            out.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Once we’d finished our meal, something happened that neither Joyce nor
            myself will ever be able to forget. After clearing our table and while we
            were still talking about our meal, he came back with a dust buster style
            hand vacuum and started vacuuming up off our table very thoroughly. It was
            the damndest thing, and Joyce and I just lifted our eyebrows and looked at
            each other in bewilderment. Was this a common thing for them to do here?
            Was it just a Uğur thing? Did he think we ourselves had just been
            particularly messy? He did it like it was the most natural thing in the
            world, grinning at us back and forth as though if not this, then what could
            a dust buster have possibly have been invented for?
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After giving us a thorough dust busting, we believe he asked us if we
            wanted any dessert. We were pretty full so instead I did the best I could
            to ask him for the bill, and he seemed a little disappointed. After paying
            and leaving him what I thought was a reasonably generous tip, I watched as
            he went inside and had an exchange with a younger man working behind the
            counter inside. I believed I saw the younger man ask Uğur how the tip was,
            and he seemed to give a shoulder shrug and raise a hand palm up as if to
            say ‘enh, adequate I guess.’ I imagined him asking himself, ‘I vacuumed
            their table, what else could I have done?’
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We soon left and spent much of the rest of the night revelling in our
            befuddlement. Over the rest of our stay in Istanbul we ate in several
            restaurants, and not one other time did we ever see anyone else break out
            the dust buster. I guess it was just a Uğur specific eccentricity… Our last
            night in Istanbul we went back there to have dinner again, but it was
            Sunday and the restaurant was all shuttered up. So we instead wound up
            having dinner at the restaurant in our hotel and although it was an
            excellent meal with a story all its own, there was no dust buster. Cenk
            Uygur has something he calls his Uygur Manoeuvre, but I’ll always remember
            the Uğur Manoeuvre to be pulling out a dust buster on unsuspecting
            Canadians.
