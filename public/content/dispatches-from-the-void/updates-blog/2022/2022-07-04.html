            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Times are strange.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I&rsquo;m getting married in September. &nbsp;Happy days. &nbsp;Honestly, that part I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about. &nbsp;Being with my partner makes me feel truly not alone for the first time in my life. &nbsp;We resonate with each other in a special way, the trust and compassion runs as deep as could ever be tested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The unexpected thing, is how clarifying the wedding has been of other relationships.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Over the last few years, maybe 3 to 5, I&rsquo;ve done an incredible amount of personal growth. &nbsp;I made a lot of mistakes, some pretty big ones in my time, and when several all came to a terrible head all at once, I went into counseling for the first time. &nbsp; I had a pretty terrible childhood in a lot of ways. &nbsp;I am always eager to point out that in the grand calculus, my life really wasn&rsquo;t all that bad. &nbsp; I never really went hungry (though we did eat &lsquo;rum-dum-diddle&rsquo; from time to time, tomato soup thickened with cheddar poured over crackers), and I&rsquo;ve never had to sleep one night outside for lack of shelter. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been relatively physically healthy my whole life. &nbsp;In these respects, compared to countless others, I&rsquo;ve been quite blessed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But there&rsquo;s the other side. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s the sister that died of brain tumors after a lengthy terrible decline when I was 2. &nbsp; There&rsquo;s the soup of misery resulting from that which my brain formed in. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s the divorce resulting from my father getting counseling for it and dealing with it then later fucking off to Australia to avoid paying child support and never really ever hearing from him afterwards, and my mother turning to the church to maintain a delusion that she was in some way still alive, intertwining her need to believe with her daughter&rsquo;s mortality. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s the toxic worldview imposed on me by the Mormon church by way of my parents, which I had to over time systematically unpack and raze to the ground before I could re-learn everything from first principles after learning about why science and skepticism are the only ways we can really know anything.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There&rsquo;s the extreme social ostracization from being a precocious &lsquo;gifted&rsquo; child who had difficulty relating to anyone around me, the absence of friends and social connections twinned with the absence of parental investment. &nbsp;No I never went hungry, but I was always absolutely starving for emotional connection, for parental investment, for any adult to take any damn interest in me or my life. &nbsp;I was so incredibly lonely as I was ultimately shuffled as a teenager between siblings and friends of theirs once living with my mother became untenable the more adversarial I became to her faith.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There&rsquo;s the absence of any plan for me, the fact that I was the first in my family to get a post secondary education, that there was no money for me to do this, that like everything else I had to do it all on my own, not just poor, but blind, with nobody guiding me, nobody warning me of things to avoid and things I should move towards.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When I tell people parts of my story, they are kind of shocked to hear it. &nbsp; It used to surprise me, I&rsquo;d think &lsquo;how can they be so surprised, so many other people had it so much worse&rsquo;. &nbsp;I figured out recently, that they&rsquo;re not surprised because what I&rsquo;ve been through is that much worse than what many others have suffered, what surprises them is how well adjusted I seem to be despite it, how much that if I didn&rsquo;t tell you what I&rsquo;d been through, you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily suspect it. &nbsp;They are surprised by the ground I&rsquo;ve traversed to get where I am, and I am in the process of internalizing that as a point of pride.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The circumstances of my life would have many people. &nbsp;Not broken in a suicide sense, but in a defeatist way, one in which they are more likely to accept their lot in life, work a series of shitty jobs, get someone pregnant and recreate all of the trauma visited upon them, mindlessly make all the same mistakes their parents made and drink or smoke themselves into an early grave. &nbsp;Something was different about me. &nbsp;I am he who survived. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s some sort of resilience engine in me, something that has always known &lsquo;you&rsquo;re better than this&rsquo;, something that has always known better was possible and left me determined to figure out how to get there. &nbsp;I never gave up; giving up was never an option.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;And now I&rsquo;ve figured things out. &nbsp;I understand the world I live in far better than most. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve now correctly oriented myself in space and time. &nbsp;After my original figuring my shit out degree and striking out as an author, I then called my shot and went to school to be a software developer, graduated just before the pandemic, got a great remote job a few months into it, healed myself enough to connect with a soul mate, and been able to buy a house together with her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There comes a point where you outgrow people. &nbsp;Maybe they used to be good for you, but now they&rsquo;re just not. &nbsp; Maybe they were on your side when you were on the same level and now they resent you for surpassing them. &nbsp;Maybe they were just the only hands extended when none other were. &nbsp;That's worth something but not everything. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky though, one gets to a point where a lot of relationships just don&rsquo;t really just fit in your life anymore. &nbsp;This has been an ongoing process for me for a while now, but this wedding thing has really accelerated it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I have two living parents, and neither of them can find it in them to care enough to come out for their only son&rsquo;s only wedding. &nbsp;My father I never really expected much more from him, but my mother surprised me. &nbsp;Fox brained zealot she is, she is of course unvaccinated, thinks Trudeau is the devil, and won&rsquo;t come &lsquo;until all vaccine mandates are lifted&rsquo;. &nbsp;And also she can&rsquo;t leave her cat, and it would cost money to come. &nbsp;Well, thank you for putting in such clear relief exactly how little I matter to you, exactly how little you are willing to sacrifice for me, exactly how little effort you are willing to put in to figure out how to manage to do this one fucking thing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Having a falling out with my sister and realizing some truths about her that I&rsquo;ve been avoiding seeing for too long, a decades long mutual friend who dumps you in favour of taking her side. &nbsp;A best friend who despite repeated warnings just can&rsquo;t get through is head that I have abandonment issues and when I&rsquo;m excluded from things it makes me a scared and frightened ostracized eight-year-old all over again and it keeps happening.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Working from home doesn&rsquo;t help, my entire social world feels like it&rsquo;s imploding in on itself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But I still have that resilience engine, that thing in me that doesn&rsquo;t understand that being satisfied with a bad status quo is an option. &nbsp;I will do what I must. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll make new friends as the person I am. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll do the work, I'll go to professional meetings, go to we work office spaces to be exposed to people, go to events on meetups to meet like-minded people. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll give up any notion of either parent ever giving another fuck about me or expecting family to mean anything. &nbsp;I will continue to evolve, and I will continue to leave people behind as a result.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I try not to feel bad about that, but I still do because it&rsquo;s still sad. &nbsp;When you&rsquo;re vulnerable and sensitive, it can&rsquo;t help but hurt when you find out that someone means a lot more to you than you ever did to them, to find your strongest connections buckle and evaporate under any pressure whatsoever.</p>
