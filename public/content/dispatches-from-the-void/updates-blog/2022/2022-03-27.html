            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;So it&rsquo;s done. I spent all weekend formatting all of the books into this website. &nbsp;Taking the books off of sales channels is a lower priority, I&rsquo;ll get around to it. &nbsp;Although, I think I might leave them up as physical copies, why not. &nbsp;I can make a note on them that they may be out of date and people should check up &nbsp;on this website for more current information. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll probably still take down even the physical copy of Launch and replace it with chasing stars. &nbsp;Maybe I&rsquo;ll just replace the words. &nbsp;Maybe I&rsquo;ll do what I said and just take it all down and start from scratch. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;My partner suggested I remove the reference to weed in the post the other day. &nbsp;She may be right. &nbsp;I shrug though, I mean it&rsquo;s legal now. &nbsp;I mean come on, the company I work for had some sort of edibles tasting even during Christmas parties festivities last year. &nbsp;The only issue it could cause for me is if somehow it comes up when trying to cross the US border and let&rsquo;s face it, these days? &nbsp;No big loss. &nbsp;And at the end of the day, all I said was an admission I <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> using it anymore</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But, I have a somewhat pathological drive to share things too intimate for me to. &nbsp;It gets me into trouble sometimes, sometimes way too much trouble. &nbsp;I have a deep seated desire to be known, to be seen, no surprise coming from where I do and the experiences I&rsquo;ve had, how unseen and undesired I&rsquo;ve always felt. &nbsp; So much of that comes through in this writing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But I <em>would</em> like to say more here. &nbsp;Nothing that could get me in trouble, but things I want to say, ideas I think should be out there even if no one is paying attention. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a reason I got the domain dispatches from the void and write my blog posts here. &nbsp;I know nobody cares or is paying attention, I&rsquo;m under no delusions about that. &nbsp;But I want to write about Star Trek: Discovery for example, both in praise and in blistering critique of different elements of it. &nbsp;Someday I want to get around to writing my philosophical paper on abortion (which I&rsquo;m sure will go over well with <em>everyone</em>).</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I may just start writing more of my journal writing here. &nbsp;Certainly and obviously there is so much that I couldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t/shouldn&rsquo;t just post publicly online, but there is certainly some. &nbsp;My private journal writing I do by hand, and it would be nice to offload some of it onto this typing format. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll see, &lsquo;stay tuned&rsquo; haha he said as if anyone is ever going to read this.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ant that&rsquo;s the problem. &nbsp; I know nobody cares about me or my writing, I mean in an attention of the world sense not in an emo sense. &nbsp;I think my books are special, well there&rsquo;s a lot of special things and people nobody ever finds out about. &nbsp;Undiscovered talent passes along unnoticed every day. &nbsp; It is the nature of things. &nbsp; Honestly if just one person who I didn&rsquo;t know and had no obligation to care stumbled upon my work and told me it really spoke to them or made a difference in their lives, that would totally do it for me, you know? &nbsp;Mission accomplished.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Oh well. &nbsp;The effort has been made, it&rsquo;s all out here for anyone to find, and although I spent all this weekend working on putting it all here on the website, next weekend will all be spent crunching through Reunion and working my way towards finishing Contact. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so happy that I&rsquo;ve found the will to take on this as a broader complete project, to complete the double trilogy. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s so going to be something when I&rsquo;m done. &nbsp;So much hard work, so much sucking it up and giving up on things that didn&rsquo;t and aren&rsquo;t working, so much trying to find grace in having it criticized, but in the end&hellip; one of those things that&rsquo;s left behind that says &lsquo;I lived, I existed&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I&rsquo;m so glad I finally had the heart to take a machete to Launch. &nbsp;They rhyme in a weird way. &nbsp;I used to refer to a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip that stuck with me. &nbsp;Someone asked Calvin what he meant when he said he was writing a fictional autobiography and he said: &lsquo;well it&rsquo;s my life, but I have a flame thrower.&rsquo; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what Launch was for me, a fictional autobiography. &nbsp;And while Chasing Stars has a lot of the much changed me I am now in it, it in the same way weirdly feels like a fictional autobiography of Launch. &nbsp; I know that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; the whole reboot thing. &nbsp;Much is the same, much is different. &nbsp;They are the same story through a looking glass, and written by writers of very different skill.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There&rsquo;s a lot going on in my life right now&hellip; a lot good but some pretty sad. &nbsp;I suppose it&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;ve found a good counselor to see. &nbsp;After my last round of counseling and having worked through everything that Launch was about, through my childhood and relationship issues, I had this weird &lsquo;end of history&rsquo; feeling, like I&rsquo;d figured it all out and now the rest of my life would just be on autopilot, liberal democracy had won, kick back, light a cigar and enjoy the spoils. &nbsp;Life doesn&rsquo;t work that way though. &nbsp;The first journal entry I wrote after that was forty thousand words and started with &lsquo;Oh the hubris of the end of history&hellip;&rsquo; &nbsp;As Q said, the trial never ends. &nbsp;Life <em>is</em> a trial, to see what you&rsquo;re made of, of answering a single question: do you choose to be good, or choose to be evil?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Try to remember it&rsquo;s just a ride. &nbsp;Try to remember the absurd contingency cubed that your existence is. &nbsp;We play the game as best we can, but we can never win in the end. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s absurd I know, but from a cosmic perspective so few get to play at all.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Lastly, I&rsquo;m both disheartened to learn that the contact button I had on this site for me was wrong and amused with myself at the thought anybody would be trying to contact me here through this. &nbsp;Nobody cares. &nbsp; Sometimes I wish they would but they don&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s fine. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather write in obscurity than debase myself by becoming a salesman; I&rsquo;ve made peace with that. &nbsp;Besides, I&rsquo;m sure that email address would have come up undeliverable, and if someone really wanted to get ahold of me they could have clicked through to my developer site and I&rsquo;m pretty easy to find online if you look for me. &nbsp;Whatever. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m a weird guy.</p>        </div>
