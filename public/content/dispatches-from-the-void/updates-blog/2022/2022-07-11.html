            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Well my week off is over so it&rsquo;s back to the work grind, so here are some updates about the actual work! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At my uncle&rsquo;s urging (<a href="https://kimaaron.ca/">check out his work here</a>), I have added a Subscribe feature to this website as part of the navbar up there, just hit subscribe and a new colour matched popup will give you the chance to sign up for updates. &nbsp;Again, not so delusional as to think there&rsquo;s big demand for this, but it will give me the opportunity to refer the few who are interested to updates to the site, things like new blog entries like this, when I do finally get around to putting the travelogue up there, and when I have new content edited and written. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s a way to gauge how many actually are following along and want to know more which is a valuable metric whether small or having grown large. &nbsp;Also at my uncle's suggestion, I also plan to create some sort of commenting system for the book chapters and these blog posts.  This will be a bit more involved than the subscription service, I'll actually have to create a database and code CRUDs since I don't want to import somethign like a word press module, but an object database comes for free with firebase and it shouldn't be too much trouble once I have the opportunity to work on it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The broader update is I have been working on Book 5: Contact. &nbsp;I hit a chapter which was lost after writing years ago and not being the start of the day it was hard to switch to writing mode, and in fact I think I&rsquo;m going to leave it unwritten until I finish editing what has already been written afterwards. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a fairly detailed description of what was in that chapter, and it&rsquo;s a good one to rewrite for the opportunity to incorporate the changes I&rsquo;m making, but still. &nbsp;Writing fresh content and editing written content are such different mindsets.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I&rsquo;m excited about the pace and adventure of this book, but I have this creeping concern that it is too much just a series of things happening to the protagonists. &nbsp;Like, I&rsquo;m getting to the third act of the book where they will be much more active, but for a while it has felt like the crew are just being taken for a ride. &nbsp;I mean that&rsquo;s kind of the intent, they&rsquo;re getting swept up in so much beyond their control and which they&rsquo;re unprepared for, but it has felt for this middle section like a lot of &lsquo;and then this happened to them, and then this happened to them, and then this happened to them, and then&hellip;&rsquo; you know? &nbsp;Still thinking about how that feeling can be assuaged.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I&rsquo;m also in that weird space where a character is leading you more than you&rsquo;re writing them. &nbsp;My main character, I noticed her taking an interest in how attractive another woman was in book 4, having to several times bury how attracted she was to her. &nbsp;In this book, it&rsquo;s 15 years later and she&rsquo;s continued to have to eat that untidy attraction. &nbsp;And now as I&rsquo;m writing, it turns out they&rsquo;d had an affair somewhere along the line, and I knew going in I wanted to break up the protagonist&rsquo;s marriage, and this will now inevitably factor into that one way or another, and then that affects how things will look for this character far down the line in the 6<sup>th</sup> book. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m only apprehensive about writing about someone dealing with unwanted same sex attractions; it&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t had to deal with myself, and want to handle the material respectfully.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;My left pinky hurts. &nbsp; Like, did I jam it? &nbsp;Am I reaching for the left shift key too much? &nbsp;Is using my newish Nintendo Switch cradle wrapping it around in a weird way? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s concerning; it&rsquo;s a remarkably important typing finger!</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I feel a little weird about my last blog post. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m prone to oversharing at the best of times, and it&rsquo;s hard to tread between what I can and should say, always wanting to say more than I should. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s something that gets me into trouble, and something I&rsquo;m actively working on. &nbsp;There is a comfort in knowing that nobody reads this stuff; it allows me to be freer in my writing. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t worry about prospective employers seeing this stuff, it will only show I&rsquo;m a complicated person with a challenging past who is actively working on improving myself. &nbsp;There are worse things. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Putting my parents on blast and shit talking my mother&rsquo;s religion, well I&rsquo;m certain neither could ever be bothered to look up what I do here and read my random blog posts, which is kind of the point and why I&rsquo;m quite happy to put it out there. &nbsp;I also don&rsquo;t want any kind of false equivalency between the two. &nbsp;My mother at least put the effort into functionally parenting me as long as she did. &nbsp; Certainly not well enough functionally or emotionally at all, but she at least tried and sacrificed and did the best she was able to. &nbsp;My father made no such efforts.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I also didn&rsquo;t want to come off like I thought I was all high and mighty above these other people. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t about people being good or bad as much as it&rsquo;s about whether or not people are good for you, mutual compatibility for what you&rsquo;re offering and needing. &nbsp;Things change, the people we are and the needs we have change. &nbsp;It&rsquo; natural for us to grow apart from people, and to find that those who have been in our lives are no longer able to satisfy our needs of them, or we&rsquo;re no longer satisfied lacking it. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a bad thing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;I am, as I have always been, and shall always continue to be, a work in progress. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The journey never ends.</p>
