        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">The time has finally come, I'm going to start writing again. I've finished catching up my
            journal finally, I've done readings I needed to, but now I'm ready to write again. It was part talking
            to my uncle about his writing and being reminded how much it saddens me that I don't write anymore. It
            was also part my best friend's girlfriend publishing her book, and being quite sad the other night that
            I didn't really write anymore. She said but it's in your soul right? I said yeah, but my soul is dead.
            Well maybe not.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">But it's also been this thing that's been bugging me for a while. I just want to keep
            bulding out my New Horizons universe, but it is still saddled with launch being the required entry
            point. Every time I think about it now let alone read it I cringe. Having written so much more
            afterwards, and now at a point in my life where I feel much less self indulgent, I see it as a fatally
            flawed text.</p>
        <p class="lead">Perhaps mor importantly, I'm ready to take and accept real criticism about my work now in a
            way I wasn't before. This won't be 'my' story like Launch was, it will just be a good story. Criticism
            will still hurt because it always doesn, but it won't hurt so personally with this one, this time
            around.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">That's not to say I don't cherish them for what they are, and I certainly want the original
            Launch to always be around for those who are interested, who want to read my diversions into this and
            that which I was excited about at the time.</p>
        <p class="lead">But now having written a couple good stories, I really want to reshape Launch into something
            which is just a really good story, you know? I want to provide an easier on ramp for people to get into
            my universe. I will have to make changes to Midway for the same reason, but also to align continuity
            with what I wrote in the new version of Launch. I imagine I'll have to change little about Arrival
            though.</p>
        <p class="lead">Bottom line is, I wrote the version of Launch that was for <em>me</em>, now I'm going to
            write the version of Launch that is for everyone else</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">I want to get back into this universe. I can do this and the looking for coding work at the
            same time. This is an important part of my life. I want to do this rewrite of launch and the subsequent
            changes to Midway, polish to production quality, and publish physical and digital. I want to polish
            Reunion to production quality and publish physical and digital. I want to write an ending for Contact
            and do the rest for it as well, and then I want to write the sixth book and finish the second trilogy!
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">I will do these things, because I enjoy it, because I enjoy my worlds. Because I live, then
            I have to write. Tonight I wrote the plot outline for the revised Launch. When I start writing I will
            post here and solicit comments after I code a comments section, cuz I can do that kind of thing now :P
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">The first chapter of the rewrite can be seen <a
                href="/content/chasing-stars/01-launch/01-chapter1.html" class="hyperlight">here</a>. I invite you to
            check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
