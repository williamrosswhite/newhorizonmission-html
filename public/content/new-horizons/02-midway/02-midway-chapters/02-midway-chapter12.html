            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kim Sun Jung sat down with her daughter Bao for lunch in the dining hall to explain shunning to her. &nbsp; It was important that she understand why it was going to happen and why it was important for her to do her part. &nbsp; &ldquo;Bao my dear, do you know what it means to shun somebody?&rdquo; &nbsp;Bao shook her head no. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the most severe sanction we have on this ship against a fellow crewmate. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been taught to do when we&rsquo;ve tried everything else and somebody still won&rsquo;t respect the most basic rules of the ship.&rdquo; &nbsp;The mother took a drink of schmilk and then took a big sigh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bao we&rsquo;ve never had to do this before and it&rsquo;ll be hard even though it can sound simple. &nbsp;It means completely ignoring somebody and pretending they don&rsquo;t exist, but everybody has to do it&hellip; and that includes you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Who is getting shunned?&rdquo; Bao asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Neil Sengupta,&rdquo; her mother answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ohh&hellip;&rdquo; Bao replied. &nbsp;She had been aware for quite a while that there was some sort of problem with Neil but it was one of those adult concerns she didn&rsquo;t have much interest in yet. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is it really that bad Amma? &nbsp;I think Neil&rsquo;s okay&hellip; I don&rsquo;t see him a whole lot, but-&ldquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Trust me my dear, it is that bad. &nbsp;At least it has apparently gotten that bad very recently. &nbsp; Neil has apparently decided that he is not going to contribute any more body or brain hours because he doesn&rsquo;t want to&hellip; and that cannot be allowed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Bao asked; always her favourite question.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because if everybody behaved the same way dear, we would all die in deep space and the whole New Horizons mission would be a failure. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s figured out that if only he or just any small group of people don&rsquo;t contribute that we&rsquo;d be just fine overall&hellip; and you know what? He may be right. &nbsp; But do you see how unfair that is to the rest of us?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes&hellip; I think I do,&rdquo; Bao offered, unsure of herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We all have to do our part with our brain and body hours, and we all benefit from each other&rsquo;s work. &nbsp;Do you see how every single hour of work Neil refuses to do, just adds to somebody else&rsquo;s burden of hours on board. &nbsp;Do you see how him refusing to contribute his share, while still consuming everyone else&rsquo;s share, is an insult to everyone who <em>does</em> contribute?&rdquo; &nbsp;Bao tentatively nodded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You know, if we were still on Earth? &nbsp;Neil could do whatever he wanted. &nbsp;He could move from one group to the next, wearing out his welcome and then moving on to the next suckers. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s just not possible here.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sun Jung sighed; she could tell there was something her daughter still didn&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp; &ldquo;There are very few ways we can sanction someone here Bao. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t believe in punishment here, but if this were another time on Earth we might have imprisoned him or even executed him, but we don&rsquo;t believe in that kind of thing now. &nbsp;If he was violent or dangerous we would have to consider quarantine but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going on here&hellip; he&rsquo;s just being belligerent.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bao wasn&rsquo;t completely sure what belligerent meant, but she knew it wasn&rsquo;t a good thing. &nbsp;She tapped at her small wrist scroll which she&rsquo;d opened and laid down beside her plate on the table, and searched the definition. &nbsp;It would be several years before she&rsquo;d be old enough to have a Brainchip implanted. &nbsp; When she read the definition of &lsquo;belligerent&rsquo; she figured her mother must be pretty upset at Neil. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We do believe in sanctions and behavioural correction though Bao, and I&rsquo;m afraid Neil has had this coming for a long time now,&rdquo; her mother concluded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have any questions?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Many&hellip;&rdquo; Bao answered, &ldquo;&hellip;always,&rdquo; she concluded with a charming smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I think I understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Once upon a time Bao, when people lived and died in villages or ancient cities&hellip; they typically would have lived their whole lives in the same place, or at least with the same people. &nbsp;Every experience of their life would have happened <em>with</em> all the same people. &nbsp;Their community would have been their whole universe. &nbsp;Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &nbsp; This, she had already been thinking about recently. &nbsp;&ldquo;Like us here on the ship?&rdquo; Bao asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes dear exactly, like here on the ship. &nbsp;In those days banishment was thought to be a far worse sentence than death. &nbsp; Banishment was sort of like shunning except that it means physically ejecting them from the village or city. &nbsp; Obviously we can&rsquo;t do that here though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bao wrinkled her nose in confusion. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why was banishment worse than death?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well for one thing death was quick, and you ended your life within the community you&rsquo;d lived. &nbsp; With banishment though&hellip; death tended to be slow and painful, and worst of all lonely. &nbsp;Banishment means your community wants to disown you and erase all trace that you were ever associated with them. &nbsp;A death sentence by comparison meant that all of your rituals around death, things which you&rsquo;d been taught from birth were really important, would still be observed. &nbsp;It meant at least being buried with others from your community and having a chance at reconciliation in the afterlife. &nbsp;With a death sentence you just lost your life, but with banishment&hellip; you lost your very identity.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s scary&hellip;&rdquo; Bao uttered. &nbsp;She got a chill down her spine at the idea of losing her identity, of being disowned&hellip; at the prospect of becoming a &lsquo;non-person&rsquo;.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Exactly. &nbsp; That&rsquo;s why shunning is our <em>last</em> resort, but also why we think it&rsquo;ll work. &nbsp; Neil is about to learn a very crucial lesson, Bao. &nbsp;He is right that we as a community don&rsquo;t have the stomach to punish him gratuitously, or to let him die by denying him the air, water, and food which he now seems to expect without any reciprocal contribution. &nbsp;He knows that we couldn&rsquo;t bring ourselves to do something like that, and he thinks he has outsmarted us by realizing it. &nbsp;But he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bao my dear, Neil is about to learn that drinking and eating isn&rsquo;t enough; that it&rsquo;s not enough just to breathe. &nbsp;He needs to learn that a human life requires more than that. &nbsp;He needs to learn that even under perfectly comfortable living conditions; we <em>all</em> need to feel connected to the human community around us in order for our lives to be tolerable. &nbsp;He needs to learn that the consequences of him refusing to do his part Bao, is losing <em>us</em>. &nbsp;He complains that he receives no payment for the work he is asked to do. &nbsp;Well he must learn and come to fully appreciate that his payment, quite simply, is our gratitude and continued acknowledgement of his existence. &nbsp;He must be taught that <em>we</em>, are the benefit that he gets from working. &nbsp;He must also understand that it is a benefit which can be <em>withdrawn&nbsp;</em>from him if he doesn&rsquo;t fulfill his end of the bargain; the same bargain we all have to make.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bao nodded; she understood. &nbsp;She never really understood how or why somebody would not want to help out on the ship. &nbsp;She did understand though why it couldn&rsquo;t be tolerated, why this was the most severe sanction they had against a non-compliant crewmate, and why it had never been used before. &nbsp;She found the idea of being ignored by everybody, of losing that precious human contact with her family and friends&hellip; a truly terrifying prospect.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It started this morning so he&rsquo;ll figure out what&rsquo;s happening pretty soon if he hasn&rsquo;t already. &nbsp; You understand what you have to do though right? &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t make eye contact. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t talk or respond to him in any way. &nbsp; When he is around you have to just pretend that he&rsquo;s not there at all, like he doesn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; her mother informed her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Bao replied.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hard Bao. &nbsp; Remember, he&rsquo;ll try to break us before he breaks himself. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll try to talk to you and to get you to answer him. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll try desperately to get you to acknowledge him in some way. &nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be especially hard for a kind and friendly girl like you,&rdquo; her mother said with a reassuring smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Amma, I can do that,&rdquo; Bao stated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As though on cue, Neil burst into the dining hall in panicked disbelief. &nbsp;He yelled aloud, &ldquo;<em>I know you can see me!!</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;He started going table to table, begging people to talk to him, to acknowledge his presence in some way. &nbsp;He had wild black eyes and black skin with the same build his grandfather Neil Sagan had had; namely, a rather large and muscular build. &nbsp;He was tall, broad shouldered, and especially scary in the half-crazed state he was in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bao leaned over to her mother and quietly asked, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t really think we can&rsquo;t see him can he?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A quiet but harsh &ldquo;<em>shhhh</em>&rdquo; was all she got back from her mother. &nbsp; Everyone else in the room had gone silent when Neil entered the room and noticing this briefest of exchanges between Bao and her mother, Neil skipped a few tables and headed right for them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bao, oh Bao, not you too, <em>you&rsquo;re</em> not going to do this to me <em>too</em>, are you? &nbsp;<em>You</em> wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> cruel would you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bao looked at the floor. &nbsp;This was harder than she thought. &nbsp;Neil got down low and tried to look in her eyes from a position with his head practically on the floor to look up into her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bao&hellip;&rdquo; he quietly and desperately pleaded, &ldquo;please&hellip; please don&rsquo;t do this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was the hardest thing Bao had ever had to do. &nbsp;Her whole life she had never felt this conflicted or at odds with herself. &nbsp;She understood that she had to be mean to Neil in order to help him in the end, but knowing that didn&rsquo;t make it any easier. &nbsp; She had as warm a heart as they came, and it was terrible for her to knowingly hurt somebody like this no matter how well intentioned the effort was. &nbsp;Ever more as the moment progressed, Bao wasn&rsquo;t sure if this step was truly necessary or if it would even work. &nbsp;By the second as he pleaded with her, she became more and more certain that she herself wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen this action against him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As warm as her heart was though, the moment was won by her steadfast sense of duty, her wish to be a good team member, and to do her part. &nbsp;Every year she more strongly identified with these values and here was Neil, unapologetically violating them. &nbsp;More important than that though, she was acutely aware that she didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to sabotage everyone else&rsquo;s effort. &nbsp;As much as she wanted to reach out to him, she understood how counter-productive it would ultimately be, and how it would only delay the inevitable, creating <em>more</em> suffering in the process.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Neil gave up trying to get a reaction out of Sun Jung and Bao and continued moving from table to table, pleading with people to acknowledge his presence. &nbsp;He apparently hadn&rsquo;t yet fully gotten the message; he still seemed to think he&rsquo;d have some allies who would side with him against everyone else. &nbsp; He did not, and that was the point.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He started climbing one of the spiral staircases up to the second level&nbsp;balconies&nbsp;and only then did Bao look up from the ground at her mother who smiled meekly at her, and squeezed her hand while giving her daughter a subtle nod in acknowledgement that she&rsquo;d done well. &nbsp;The two listened for several more minutes as Neil searched for allies upstairs, anybody who would say <em>anything</em> to him or acknowledge his presence in <em>any</em> way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Neil finally stormed down the stairs, now more angry than panicked. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>FUCK YOU ALL!!!</em>&rdquo; He roared. &nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need <em>any</em> of you. &nbsp;You all think your attention is <em>really</em> that important <em>don&rsquo;t you</em>!? &nbsp;Well you&rsquo;re <em>WRONG!!</em>&nbsp; When the transmission comes there will be <em>years</em> of new media for me to occupy myself with and I&rsquo;m going to tell the whole <em>fucking</em> Terran Solar System what you miserable <em>bastards</em> are doing to me.&rdquo; &nbsp;He was quiet for a few moments after that, as though he were expecting a reaction. &nbsp;When he finally realized that he was only talking to himself, he left without saying another word.</p>
