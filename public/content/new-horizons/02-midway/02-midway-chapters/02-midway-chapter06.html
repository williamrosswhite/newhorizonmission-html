            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Grandpa!!&rdquo; &nbsp;It was late in the evening when Johannes returned to his family quarters. &nbsp;In reality it was his daughter and son-in-law&rsquo;s suite, but he&rsquo;d been living there the last two years or so with them since his wife had died. &nbsp;His seven year old grandson Zarif and nine year old granddaughter Setia were excited to see him again after he had been gone all day. &nbsp; He was usually the one to watch them when their parents were off on duty and it was not school hours. &nbsp;&ldquo;We missed you! &nbsp;But uncle Tycho has been teaching us how to play chess!&rdquo; &nbsp;Zarif proudly exclaimed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, <em>trying</em> to teach them how to play chess anyways,&rdquo; Tycho chuckled. &nbsp; &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d it go Johannes?&rdquo; &nbsp;In his teens when Tycho was newly asserting his adolescent independence he&rsquo;d started calling his father by his first name. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d fought about it for years but eventually Johannes gave up and by that point it felt weird when Tycho tried to call him &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; again after he felt he&rsquo;d &lsquo;won.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The old man hugged his grandchildren even tighter. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know what? &nbsp;I really don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Tycho just shrugged. &nbsp; &ldquo;Alright&hellip; well Kirana and Seth said they&rsquo;d both be back in about forty-five&hellip; er,&rdquo; he looked at the clock in the kitchen, &ldquo;make that about half an hour from now. &nbsp;The kids have eaten so&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to take off now, alright?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sure. &nbsp;Thanks again Tycho.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No problem, bye kids!&rdquo; he added as he gave a last quick tickle to Zarif as he passed by the two children again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;In the morning, while Johannes, Kirana, Seth, Zarif, and Setia were all sitting down to breakfast together, the door chimed the announcement of someone on the other side. &nbsp; Johannes thought the door open and in walked Anaru Tynes, looking cheerful but nonetheless a little bleary-eyed and sleep deprived.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good morning Bowlands, how are we doing today?&rdquo; &nbsp;He received the requisite hellos and non-committal responses as to how they were doing. &nbsp;&lsquo;Good&rsquo; seemed to be the most popular response. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wonderful. &nbsp;Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I need to borrow your grandfather for a moment, alright?&rdquo; &nbsp; Johannes nodded at him and then got up from the table, and together they went into his private bedroom.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Johannes, I uh&hellip; I had trouble sleeping last night after everything, so I thought I&rsquo;d get a little leg work done for you and save you some time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip; oh okay well that&rsquo;s great, what have you found?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, I found out that Dhika was still awake so I asked her to meet up with me in the dining hall. &nbsp;We went through the personnel records and together we put together a list of the people that we think were capable of pulling off hacking into the Brainchip logs, and manipulating them without being detected. &nbsp;<em>That&nbsp;</em>got us about thirty names. &nbsp; We then went over the Brainchip logs that <em>do</em> exist, and cross referenced those names against the surveillance footage. &nbsp;We were able to eliminate twenty or so by confirming that they were where the logs said they should be at the time of the murder. &nbsp;That is of course, based on Min&rsquo;s twelve hour window around the estimated time of death.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I appreciate that, but if this person can manipulate the Brainchip logs,&nbsp;then-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Anaru put up his hand to stop him and pursed his lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know, I know. &nbsp;But Dhika assures me that manipulating the video itself even a little bit, would be impossible without detection. &nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t think that even <em>she</em> could do that. &nbsp;She said that it would take a physical manipulation of the records, as opposed to simply breaking an encryption like with the Brainchip logs. &nbsp;Just in case though, she&rsquo;s running a trace program over the video logs to look for anomalies. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure what she means by all that, but I trust her judgment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well me too, so we&rsquo;ll have to go with that for now. &nbsp;Wait, how much did you tell her?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I told her about the murder. &nbsp;I know you wanted to keep it quiet but we&rsquo;re going to need her technical expertise and secrets don&rsquo;t keep for very long on this ship anyways. &nbsp;I trust her not to tell anyone <em>else&nbsp;</em>though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fair enough&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think of any reason to doubt her discretion in any case.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, well I was able to strike another three off of our list personally since they were with me at my weekly card game the night it happened. &nbsp;That left us seven names, only four of which are men.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Four hunh? &nbsp; Alright, let me see the list,&rdquo; Johannes said and looked it over after being handed the scroll. &nbsp;Each was as impossibly suspect as the rest. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, well we need to set up an interrogation room, and arrange interviews for everyone on the list. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll need a set up for clear video recording of their faces while I question them, okay? &nbsp;I need to be able to go back to the recording and look for micro expressions which could reveal deception.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
