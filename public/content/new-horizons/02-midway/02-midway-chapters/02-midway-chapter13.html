            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>Fifteen years ago&hellip;&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was late at night. &nbsp;Dhika and Tycho had snuck into one of the two shuttles which were nestled in between the ion engines. &nbsp;The shuttles were usually kept docked behind the central engineering section which shielding the crafts from any stray oncoming interstellar debris. &nbsp; They&rsquo;d grabbed a snack from the dining hall earlier, but they were now floating in the microgravity, wrapped up in a blanket which was attached to one of the Velcro strips on the bulkhead of the shuttle. &nbsp;By holding the blanket to their bodies, they kept themselves in place against the wall with it. &nbsp;Against the opposite wall they had attached the large pad they&rsquo;d brought with them, and they were watching some programs which had been received in the transmission from Earth a few weeks ago. &nbsp;The interval between this transmission and the previous one had been almost twelve long years, and they were warned that the next one would not arrive for another fifteen years. &nbsp;Any kind of productive two way conversation had long ago become a practical impossibility since a simple question and response was now officially a multi decadal affair.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It had become tradition to continue the conversation with Earth by sending bundled data bursts back and forth between the ship and Earth. &nbsp;People had originally had live conversations, but as they got further and further away from Earth, there was an increasing lag time. &nbsp;The light could only move so quickly. &nbsp;Using lasers made the transmission more reliable and allowed far greater bandwidth than radio, but there was still an absolute cosmic speed limit on light. &nbsp;Eventually carrying out actual conversations became completely unworkable, and communication became more like a conversation by mail, where delivery time started out as minutes, but then became hours, then days, then months&hellip; and now years.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At first there was a lot of back and forth between the ship and Earth, but over time people tended to line up their individual actions with the official transmissions. &nbsp;Now most conversations were synced up, simplifying things into one great conversation, resulting in back and forth mass data bursts via the transmission of invisible laser light. &nbsp;Along the central axis of the ship there was a powerful laser which the New Horizon used to transmit messages to its home system. &nbsp; The interferometric telescope array was able to automatically swap its optical detectors between the highly sensitive ones used for astronomical observations, and ones specialized to receive laser communications.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The official back and forth transmission, the one everyone else had over time piggy backed onto, consisted essentially, of absolutely <em>everything</em> being sent in <em>both</em> directions. &nbsp;Earth sent the ship updates on all of their databases, from entertainment and educational media, to research journals, weather records, biography files, encyclopedia entries, news archives, and all of Earth&rsquo;s consequential media and information which had been produced since their last transmission. &nbsp;New Horizon&rsquo;s crew sent back all of their logs and crew records, and all still to the same mission control on the Orbital One space station in orbit around Earth back home. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Some of the crew also sent personal messages and artistic submissions of one form or another. &nbsp; Others kept detailed personal logs and sent them back to the planet; those who did became quiet the celebrities on Earth and in this last transmission they had even begun to receive some fan mail. &nbsp;It was their last and only link between the ship&rsquo;s crew and the ship&rsquo;s homeworld, and the link grew longer and thinner every day. &nbsp;Since they cleared the Oort cloud, it had become ever clearer just how tenuous that connection really was. &nbsp;It was really just them, out here&hellip; in the middle of nowhere.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Dhika and Tycho were watching a movie which had apparently won a bunch of awards, but the two fifteen year olds were so far not very impressed. &nbsp;It was about the reconstruction and reconciliation process after the Nuclear Tragedy of 2042. &nbsp;The opening credits were laid over file footage of the tragedy itself, from helicopter news cameras to scroll video, all showing either the meteor strike or a growing nuclear mushroom cloud off in the distance. &nbsp;These amateur videos were interspersed with footage from high altitude drones and satellites showing the detonations in frighteningly crisp detail. &nbsp; After this beginning though, it became a drama about people trying to pick up the pieces of their lives afterwards in the decimated region. &nbsp;An interesting story, but hard for the two to identify with and get emotionally invested in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the movie ended, Dhika winked the scroll&rsquo;s screen off while the credits rolled. &nbsp;She straightened her body out and let out a frustrated sigh. &nbsp;She then turned to Tycho, put her hand on his cheek, and kissed him. &nbsp;At first he gave in to her, and it was a moment that had an impact on Dhika for some reason. &nbsp;She remembered that moment, and it stuck with her. &nbsp;He let her kiss him, but just for a moment. &nbsp;He then pushed her off, gently but firmly, and she threw her head back against the bulkhead of the shuttle in frustration. &nbsp;She then ripped her blanket off the wall and gathered it up, then pushed herself off of the wall towards the airlock.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Dhika&hellip;&rdquo; Tycho offered meekly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; Dhika hissed. &nbsp;&ldquo;We spend so much time together, I&hellip; I know you <em>like&nbsp;</em>me&hellip; but nothing ever <em>happens</em>! &nbsp;What&rsquo;s wrong? &nbsp; Is it me? &nbsp;You <em>hurt</em> me Tycho.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Tycho approached her and held her face in his hands and looked in her eyes. &nbsp;He then hugged her and put her head on his shoulder. &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you Dhika&hellip; if you don&rsquo;t believe anything else, please believe that.&rdquo; &nbsp;They pulled away from each other after the hug.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well then what is it?&rdquo; Dhika asked, wiping a tear away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t&hellip; feel that way, about <em>anyone</em>&hellip; ever. &nbsp;The idea of&hellip; sex, with anyone, I just&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t find it appealing at all Dhika, the opposite really.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to believe Tycho&hellip;&rdquo; Dhika stated plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth&hellip;&rdquo; Tycho offered listlessly, staring at the floor.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Dhika caught herself on a railing, and turned around to stare at him. &nbsp;This explanation would be consistent with his behaviour so far. &nbsp; Something about the beginning of that kiss though&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay Tycho&hellip; okay,&rdquo; Dhika uttered, shaking her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we head home though. &nbsp;Tycho nodded his agreement and together they made their way through the airlock. &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t talk at all as they made their way to the habitat ring and walked down the central corridor, and when it was time to part ways towards their own family&rsquo;s suites, they offered each other only a simple goodnight.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After walking alone the rest of the way, Dhika came to her door and stopped in front of it, then turned and fell backwards against it. &nbsp;She slowly bonked the back of her head against the door once&hellip; then twice, then a third time. &nbsp;After a pause she winked a communication request to Anaru and pulled her small wrist scroll out of her pocket. &nbsp;Before long Anaru&rsquo;s face appeared on the scroll&rsquo;s screen.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Anaru asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing much&hellip;&rdquo; Dhika said. &nbsp;&ldquo;You wanna watch a movie with me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Dhika and Tycho would remain the closest of friends for the rest of their lives. &nbsp;Their strengths played off each other and their mutual appreciation of frank and sometimes brutal honesty kept them each other&rsquo;s closest confidants. &nbsp;But there would forever be a clear ceiling on what their relationship could be, and over the years Dhika would become more and more accepting of Tycho as he was, and sometimes even grateful for it. &nbsp;She would grow to suspect that if they had mated then, their relationship would have burned very brightly, but only briefly. &nbsp; This way though, they could become, and remain, even closer than that. &nbsp;They were lifelong friend and confidants, all things to each other except sexual.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When Dhika went to Anaru&rsquo;s that night she established the rules with him. &nbsp;Anaru had been flirting with her of late, and he obviously had a singular interest in her since they had never had much in common, and never had much to do with each other socially. &nbsp;Her terms were simple; she didn&rsquo;t care what he did with whomever else, but he could have her, when she wanted him, if he could keep quiet about it. &nbsp;She made it clear it would stop if anyone found out. &nbsp;He simply nodded and immediately went after her with an appetite which had been building for some time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As years went by for Dhika and Anaru, they became close friends as well as physically close &nbsp;However, they never came close to having the same kind of emotional connection which Dhika and Tycho enjoyed, they were close nonetheless. &nbsp; Close enough to talk to each other if something was bothering them, and close enough to seek each other&rsquo;s council on tough decisions. &nbsp;As they matured and became adults with greater and greater responsibilities on the ship, their relationship continued to mature as they themselves did.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;This arrangement worked for all of them. &nbsp;It was a tidy triangle and all three of them had what they wanted out of another of the three, and they were all spared the parts they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> want. &nbsp;Tycho got the close emotional support that he wanted from Dhika without all the messy sexuality. &nbsp;Dhika got the sexual relationship she missed with Tycho from Anaru, but without all of the messy romantic entanglements which would have complicated her friendship with Tycho. &nbsp;Anaru got the regular sex with Dhika he was looking for, without the same messy romantic entanglements Dhika didn&rsquo;t care for, while still having the freedom to pursue other women. &nbsp;It was a very tidy triangle indeed, and for a time&hellip; things were good.</p>
