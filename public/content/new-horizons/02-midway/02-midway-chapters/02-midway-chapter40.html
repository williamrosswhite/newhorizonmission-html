            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>Three days later&hellip;</em></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Main ion engines disengaging in five&hellip; four&hellip;. three&hellip; two&hellip; one&hellip; and&hellip; engines down,&rdquo; K&rsquo;uuna declared. &nbsp;Maharet and Johannes were overseeing the operation and were ready to assist while Dhika, Seth, and K&rsquo;uuna conducted it themselves.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alrighty&hellip; we are officially back on course,&rdquo; Dhika declared to the matriarch and patriarch as she swiveled around in the captain&rsquo;s chair to face them. &nbsp;They had drawn lots for who would get to play captain in the exercise, and Dhika had won. &nbsp;The two nodded and the younger woman swung back around and called out: &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s put our front forward again&hellip; set forward starboard thrusters and rear port thrusters for a ten second push&hellip; ready Seth?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Engage.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Seth tapped the panel in front of him and they could all feel the slight pull to their left as the ship started rotating. &nbsp;&ldquo;And&hellip; ten second push on the inverse?&rdquo; Dhika asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Seth answered again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Count us down, K&rsquo;uuna&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ten seconds&hellip;&rdquo; he called out, then: &ldquo;five&hellip; four&hellip; three&hellip; two&hellip; one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Engage,&rdquo; Dhika commanded, and Seth tapped at his panel. &nbsp;Again they could feel the modest acceleration to their right this time as their overall yaw rotation returned to zero. &nbsp;They then repeated the whole same procedure all over again to turn the pitch of their nose back down to face their destination. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright then, good work everyone. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re facing forward and back on course to Haven.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Thinking a command with her Brainchip, Maharet opened a shipwide broadcast channel and patched the tiny microphone in her EAR through to it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>&ldquo;Thanks to the good work of my daughter Dhika as well as K&rsquo;uuna and Seth, I am happy to report that we are once again on course for Haven. &nbsp;I thank them, but I&rsquo;d also like to thank all of you, for your composure, and for your professionalism during the crises of the last month. &nbsp;You are all a testament to the spirit with which this mission originally launched.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Johannes leaned in to speak quietly to Dhika. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dhika, Maharet and I would like to speak to you alone for a moment please.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She didn&rsquo;t know where this was going, but she nevertheless got up from the captain&rsquo;s chair and went with him. &nbsp;Maharet joined them and the three went out through the bridge door and stood in the hallway together.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; Maharet said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re concerned about the further disruption an election for captain would have right now. &nbsp;With everything that&rsquo;s happened&hellip; we think it might be better at this point to just make an appointment on our mutual authority. &nbsp;Since we were both elected it&rsquo;s not explicitly forbidden by the mission protocols.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Oh? &nbsp;Okay&hellip; who?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her mother gave her an incredulous look. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, <em>you</em> of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip; wait, what? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t understand, how could you do that to Seth? &nbsp;To K&rsquo;uuna in there? &nbsp;I, I can&rsquo;t! &nbsp;Oh hell, I don&rsquo;t <em>want&nbsp;</em>that, they&rsquo;ll resent me for<em>ever</em>! &nbsp;People will talk and&hellip; think it&rsquo;s a conspiracy or something!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But a divisive election will be such a disruption right now, it&rsquo;s so not what the crew needs at this point,&rdquo; Johannes offered. &nbsp; He appeared tired to Dhika, unusually exhausted like he hadn&rsquo;t slept since the incident on the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a <em>scandal</em> Johannes, and <em>that</em> is what the ship <em>really</em> doesn&rsquo;t need right now. &nbsp;It may be in accordance with formal protocol but it&rsquo;s the <em>wrong thing to do</em>. &nbsp;A proper election is <em>exactly</em> what this ship needs right now, something&hellip; normal, something they can understand! &nbsp;People need a chance to express their wishes at this point; this crew needs a chance to air things out and for everyone to have their say.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip;&rdquo; her mother conceded, shaking her head. &nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; &nbsp;She pulled her daughter into a hug. &nbsp;&ldquo;You saying it though,&rdquo; she remarked as she hugged her, &ldquo;just makes me think you should be the captain that much more though&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Dhika chuckled, relieved. &nbsp;When released from her mother&rsquo;s embrace she leaned over to look at the two men in the bridge who she figured would be her toughest competition in the election. &nbsp; &ldquo;Before all this&hellip;&rdquo; she said, standing up again and addressing her two superiors, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have even ran&hellip; but Alissa said she would support me if I became&nbsp;the&nbsp;captain. &nbsp;With her gone now&hellip; somehow I feel like I owe it to <em>her</em> to run, even if it means running against her husband.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I respect that,&rdquo; Johannes offered, somewhat distantly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alissa had&nbsp;a&nbsp;very aggressive spirit my dear; I&rsquo;m sure whoever wins she would have wanted them to have had to fight hard for it.&rdquo; &nbsp; Her daughter&nbsp;nodded in&nbsp;agreement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; Johannes said, &ldquo;have you had a chance to examine the sims?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not closely,&rdquo; Dhika answered, &ldquo;but I did have a look. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t appear that they&rsquo;ve been damaged by their activities or the kill switch, and it looks like the original programming is intact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s&nbsp;good... at least that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; Maharet suggested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;As you know, they can&rsquo;t be simply turned off again once they&rsquo;re fully activated so I can&rsquo;t initialize them to know for sure. &nbsp; I can only wipe the makeshift slave system Tycho loaded into them, and hope that they wake up intact&nbsp;the way&nbsp;they&rsquo;re supposed to when they arrive at Haven.&rdquo;</p>
