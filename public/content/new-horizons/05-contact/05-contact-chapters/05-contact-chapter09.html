            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Two hours later, any repairs which could been made had been. &nbsp;All in all, they&rsquo;d been lucky. &nbsp;None of the thinned sections of the hull showed any signs of giving way, but the areas remained evacuated and sealed as a precaution. &nbsp;Some of their instrument packages on the far side of the ship had been spared by the blast; they&rsquo;d only been shorted out and the engineers had been able to bring them back online, same for the instruments towards the rear of the ship. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They still had only one remaining main wall display panel on the bridge, but it was sufficient for navigation. &nbsp;In truth they didn&rsquo;t really need any of the wall monitors since every individual station had its own dedicated display, most of which remained functional. &nbsp; Still, compared to the three-sixty view they had had, the barren lifeless surfaces which now surrounded them seemed eerie somehow, almost claustrophobic in a way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;So far they had remained in a standard orbit around Yuri, but the alien vessel so far had shown no signs of activity. &nbsp;Things were calming down a bit and more thoughtful consideration now possible. &nbsp; Kathryn had given everyone an hour off to eat or catch a quick nap or whatever they wished to recharge while she and the rest of the senior staff planned their next move.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn, Jaren, Maggie, Felix, and Margaret were all sitting around a table in the captain&rsquo;s private dining room off of the main mess hall discussing their options.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Protocol would be to report in and request further instructions,&rdquo; Jaren observed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Phbbt, protocol&hellip;&rdquo; Margaret dismissively retorted.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s what we should do,&rdquo; he snapped, then softened, feeling bad about barking at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&hellip; stating a fact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We all know what those instructions would be,&rdquo; Felix stated. &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d order us back.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d want us to just leave that thing out there?&rdquo; Maggie asked, it was inconceivable that anyone would want them to just leave it floating in space, to just walk away from a mystery of that magnitude.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes hon,&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;This ship was built to be ready for that kind of situation, but we&rsquo;ve been severely damaged. &nbsp;Impressive as it is, this ship was not built for investigating a damaged and hostile alien vessel of unknown origin.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No ship in the fleet was,&rdquo; Jaren observed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;In fact, damaged or not, this ship is the closest we have to being designed and equipped for such a mission.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Also true,&rdquo; Kathryn agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thing is, we were only allowed to assume command of this mission because it was expected to be routine. &nbsp;Yes it was the first new star system we&rsquo;d created access to, but we weren&rsquo;t expecting to find anything particularly&hellip; exciting.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Margaret retorted. &nbsp;&ldquo;You three are more qualified than anyone else in the fleet for just this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she granted, &ldquo;but they might also want to give this additional experience to others who could use it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fuck that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn chuckled. &nbsp;She felt an agreement with the sentiment, but was nonetheless sympathetic to those who were being robbed of her experience. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are required to check in,&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll recall us, refit the ship, assemble a new crew, send us home and the ship back for further investigation,&rdquo; Felix outlined with disappointment he made no attempt to hide.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What if there&rsquo;s somebody over there who needs help?&rdquo; Maggie asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret pointed to the girl. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kid&rsquo;s got a point.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked over to Jaren who tilted his head to the side with raised eyebrows and looking at her somewhat sideways. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t suggesting it was the right move, but that it was a defensible justification.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is a ship in clear distress over there, in a distressed state we caused no less. &nbsp; We could be said to have an obligation to render any assistance we could.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; Margaret encouraged her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And the only way to do that would could assess what needs they might have if they remain incommunicative would be to board it and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It would still be expected of us to report in our intentions,&rdquo; Jaren reiterated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm. &nbsp; Felix, how long until our scheduled check in?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Five days. &nbsp; Our first was just a couple days ago.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How long would it take to get to that ship?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At two gee? &nbsp; About a day, twelve hour push then another twelve pull.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; Well I think we would need to provide a very meticulously detailed account of everything that&rsquo;s happened here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Felix answered with a smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And how long do you think that would take to gather up all that data into one convenient transmission?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh it wouldn&rsquo;t be quick Admiral, twenty four hours at least.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good man. &nbsp; So it&rsquo;s settled. &nbsp;We will immediately get underway for the alien ship at two gee. &nbsp;When your report to command is ready Felix we will of course send it immediately. &nbsp;In the meantime we will meet our obligation to render whatever aid we can to the vessel clearly in distress out there. &nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make specific boarding plans along the way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Everyone nodded their understanding.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright then everyone go and get to work. &nbsp;As soon as we&rsquo;re underway and you&rsquo;ve made all the preparations you can for our encounter with that ship, the crew can have free time until two hours before the encounter. &nbsp; Dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix and Margaret left the room, and seemingly in pretty good moods too.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maggie, are you okay with this?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not comfortable or if you&rsquo;re too scared we could still call the whole thing off, phone in, get sent home&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fourteen Mom. &nbsp;I can handle myself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn pushed some air out her nose as she smiled and looked down to the side.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I came out here with you hoping for some adventure and a story to tell. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting a lot more than I expected. &nbsp; That&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, fair enough. &nbsp;Now run along to your quarters while we get ready. &nbsp;We can spend some time together while we&rsquo;re in transit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay Mom&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp; The girl seemed disappointed to be again relegated to her quarters, but she obeyed and the door closed behind her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Am I a terrible mother?&rdquo; Kathryn asked, only half serious.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Only as terrible as I am a father,&rdquo; Jaren answered thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;The girls&rsquo; got a point though. &nbsp;She came out here for a story and she&rsquo;s getting it. &nbsp;In theory the part she really shouldn&rsquo;t have been here for has already passed, and she seemed to handle it remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s only because she doesn&rsquo;t really understand how close we all came to being killed?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do the young ever really understand the possibility of death?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn smiled and put her hand on his arm. &nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip; but isn&rsquo;t that why they have parents?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The acceleration came on slowly, and the two felt themselves become weighted to the ground. &nbsp; When it reached two gee, their bodies felt remarkably heavy, like they were wearing lead suits. &nbsp;Prolonged exposure to two gee was considered safe, but it wasn&rsquo;t especially pleasant. &nbsp;While it was possible to get around and do work with great effort, the most comfortable thing to do was just to lie down. &nbsp;So, when everyone&rsquo;s prep work was done, they were free to do just that.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The ship first broadened its orbit around Yuri, and then once effectively free of its gravity well set sail for the alien ship. &nbsp;Of course it was never as easy as a straight line in a solar system, but aside from some course corrections as the outset, along the way, and on approach, the bulk of the trip would indeed be a straight two gee burn.</p>
