            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Report,&rdquo; she ordered as she entered the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All ships report ready Admiral,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then by all means Admiral, let&rsquo;s get started.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got a long day ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Brinkerhoff nodded and turned to the comms station.&nbsp; &ldquo;Commander Grayson, please signal the fleet that we are opening the rift.&nbsp; Ready all offensive and defensive systems.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman nodded and touched her ear to her earpiece as she tapped on her panel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All ships set Condition One throughout the fleet.&rdquo; she was heard saying over the comm system.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ready all offensive and defensive weapons.&nbsp; All hands to battle stations.&nbsp; Prepare for rift transit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kathryn could hear the nervousness in her voice, Brinkerhoff too, and wondered how much they heard it in hers.&nbsp; They were play actors all of them, pretending to experience which none of them had, but that&rsquo;s what the endless hours of training in the simulators were for, to know reflexively what to say, do, and think when their nerves shut down the thinky parts of their brains and the training was all they had to rely on.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Lieutenant Tarsis, Condition One please,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff ordered their operations order, following his own orders once heard over the fleet wide channel, as their training demanded.&nbsp; The lights dimmed and red light perfused the bridge as shadow matter shielding overtook the heavy glass windows at the front of the bridge, immediately replaced with a large projected screen showing the CIC display with the positions of all of the ships in theatre relative to the crystal, a deadly convoy lined up for transport through the rift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All ships report ready,&rdquo; Grayson called out as the screen showed the last ship icon flip red.&nbsp; Kathryn took a moment to appreciate the gravity of the undertaking, the size of a fleet only imaginable so few weeks earlier.&nbsp; It was a day that would never be forgotten if anyone was left afterwards to remember it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn touched the fleet wide comms control on the neighbouring captain&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;For Kobol,&rdquo; she sternly offered the fleet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make the bastards pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice dripped with cold vengeance.&nbsp; The sentiment was more for fleet morale, but when she said it she was far from immune from the charge of vengeful blood lust it filled her with at remembering what they&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; A chorus of &lsquo;Hoo-Rah&rsquo;s called back over the comm network.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Brinkerhoff nodded approvingly to her, offering a silent Hoo-Rah of his own before turning to the operations station.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tarsis, trigger the rift.&nbsp; Bob, ready our decoy ships.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Pillars of light from the secondary solar collectors poured unfathomable amounts of energy down onto the giant crystal and after a few moments it exploded into the familiar purple vapour cloud.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up Bob.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shifted the CIC display to one of the smaller displays to the side of the main display and put main visual up on the main screen.&nbsp; They watched as the first giant icosahedron ship disappeared into the void of the rift, and then the second, and then the third.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t afford to wait to see what if anything was reported back from the other side before continuing to file the ships through.&nbsp; Every second of surprise and denying the enemy an opportunity to react tipped the odds more in their favour.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As the flagship, New Horizon II was eighth in line, first behind the heavy icosahedron warships and ahead of the rest of the human ships and smaller Bobbin ships.&nbsp; As she watched the ship ahead of them disappear into the rift she heard Grayson report: &ldquo;Getting confirmation from the other side that the cloud screen had been successfully established.&nbsp; Exit vectors being fed into the fleet&rsquo;s nav computers.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Steady as she goes Mr. Byrne,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff ordered the pilot and a few moments later they were in the rift.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The primary view screen shimmered out along with the rest of reality as they passed through the rift, and when they exited the same purple haze which took up their entire field of view as the entered the rift persisted.&nbsp; The CIC display showed their new course being automatically locked in but before they could engage the ship was rocked by a heavy hit of enemy weapons.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The displays showed their orientation spinning out before the navigational computer righted their trajectory and hauled ass for their designated exit point.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Kathryn yelled, for the moment forgetting to marvel at their not being a paste on the rear bulkhead thanks to the inertial dampening system the Bobbins had installed on all of the human ships.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>REPORT!!</em>&rdquo; Brinkerhoff roared after too many moments of the question not being answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I need-&rdquo;&nbsp; Another strong strike rocked this ship, but Kathryn could tell by feel it was more of a glancing blow than the first, and their course was easily corrected.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Tarsus said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Looks like when they realized what was happening they started just firing blind towards the last known position of the crystal.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve gotten some lucky strikes but so far-</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Kathryn interrupted him as the first human ship got blown apart by the blind fire at the mouth of the rift, the ships coming through afterwards striking the debris and taking additional damage.&nbsp; The shared encrypted network of data shared between the friendly ships provided enough information about what was going on at the mouth of the crystal.&nbsp; Though limited, it was better that the total blindness the enemy was having to deal with.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and that explosion will give them a better fix on where to target.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not a great start,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff said, turning to her.&nbsp; It was neither an accusation nor admission of defeat, just a dry observation which she nodded in agreement to.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re committed either way now,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; They both turned back to the CIC display and watched the convoy exit, and each head in a new direction at maximum acceleration towards their designated targets.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn studied the readouts.&nbsp; It was bad, but within the error bars of their projections.&nbsp; They were outnumbered almost three to one but not quite, and their lead ships had successfully mapped the enemy ship locations before everyone&rsquo;s sensors became useless in the cloud.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d all certainly scattered from those positions since, but it was a place to start.&nbsp; Once the first friendly ships exited the cloud the battle network would update their live positions.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they exited the cloud, their screaming still accelerating velocity happened to be taking them on a trajectory that put them on a direct collision course with an enemy icosahedron.&nbsp; Slamming maximum thrust in a perpendicular direction would be enough to move them just barely out of way, assuming the enemy vessel declined to shift their position in exactly the same direction.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Brinkerhoff stood from his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;As soon as we pass that ship put a torpedo up their ass please Commander Sengupta,&rdquo; he calmly requested as he put a hand on the backs of the pilot and comm station&rsquo;s chairs.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;With pleasure, sir&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took too long for the enemy ship to acquire their position so in close, and by the time they&rsquo;d passed them and gained enough distance it was too late.&nbsp; Less than a second after they&rsquo;d passed them, their first torpedo fired back behind them, and instantaneously vapourized most of the enemy ship in a blinding flash with the main viewscreen dimmed down to a less than blinding level while it needed to.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Direct hit sir, target down.&rdquo; Sengupta reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hoo-Rah!,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff exclaimed with calm excitement but obvious satisfaction.&nbsp; Target every ship in range and fire at will.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few seconds later as the last of four torpedoes exited their launchers and showed up on the CIC screen with dotted lines from them to their target on meandering randomized courses, they were rocked by a blast much harder than the first one they&rsquo;d taken after exiting the rift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Kathryn uttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought the <em>first</em> hit we took was at full strength!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Apparently not,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff remarked as they both looked at the missiles and their targets, one of which had been the one to fire the shot.&nbsp; One of the missiles was shot down and Kathryn&rsquo;s heart sank, then sunk further when a second was as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sengupta, shield status.&rdquo; she ordered.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nearly depleted already Admiral, I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; That last shot burned up half of the ablative shadow matter.&nbsp; The point defence geometry system is successfully orientating to the shots to take the blast, but it burns off so much of it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think we can take another shot at full strength.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The remaining torpedoes struck their targets and another two enemy ships were taken off the board.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fuck yeah, gotcha bitch!&rdquo; Brinkerhoff exclaimed causing Kathryn to glance over at him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d either given up or lost the ability to maintain his composure in the heat of the battle, but she concluded for the moment that it wasn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She surveyed the CIC screen and took assessed the overall situation across the fleet.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d downed a lot of enemy ships, they did seem blessedly unprepared or unable to counter the combination of Bobbin torpedoes and human anti-matter, but they were losing too many ships.&nbsp; Thirty to fifteen (or whatever).&nbsp; Their losses to their own were two to one, but it just wasn&rsquo;t enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have to be smarter&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered to herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob!&rdquo; she exclaimed, leaping out of her chair and coming over to crouch down beside him at his station.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need more shadow matter to replenish our shields.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took him a moment to stop the chatter with the other Bobbin ships in their own language before turning to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I agree that would help, but we just don&rsquo;t have any,&rdquo; he quickly answered.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But listen, when we down their ships, they are only <em>largely</em> destroyed.&nbsp; Enough material is annihilated to leave them inoperable but there are still pieces left over, right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The alien&rsquo;s eye stalks tilted to the side quizzically before turning back to his station without another word to her, but a great deal of chatter to the other bobbins.&nbsp; The rest of the bridge erupted in cheers as another two enemy ships were destroyed from the next volley of torpedoes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob?&rdquo; she asked as she turned back around.&nbsp; He held up his three taloned arm in request that she wait.&nbsp; She looked back at the screen.&nbsp; Twenty to ten (or whatever).</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Bob!</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; he added through his mirror ball and she wondered what in his language he&rsquo;d actually said for his mirror ball to approximate the slang.&nbsp; His feet clacked as he turned around in place to face the front of the bridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admiral Brinkerhoff,&rdquo; we have reconfigured the ablative shielding to absorb the shadow matter of the downed enemy ships.&nbsp; You just need to make physical contact with it to your own ships.&nbsp; Please retransmit to your remaining fleet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn saw open concern in Brinkerhoff face for the first time as he looked back up at the CIC screen, possibly noticing how badly things were actually going for them at the strategic level despite their own ship&rsquo;s combat success so far.&nbsp; He merely pointed to Lieutenant Commander Grayson and she nodded before swiveling back in her chair to relay the information.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Safe impact speed?&rdquo; the pilot asked without looking away from his controls.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Low unfortunately,&rdquo; Bob answered, correctly intuiting the meaning of the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;When released from control systems,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;it reverts to something like a liquid with the density of water in vacuum, so whatever is structurally possible given the situation of the ship of that kind of impact resistance.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; the pilot responded grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; he informed Brinkerhoff.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty low relative velocity.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll make us vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff said, &ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo; he ordered, putting a reassuring hand on the pilot&rsquo;s shoulder before turning back to resume his seat in the captain&rsquo;s chair.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&lsquo;Damn, seven to three (or whatever)&rsquo; Kathryn observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to make it!&rsquo; her thoughts screamed at herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nearest reservoir found,&rdquo; the pilot reported, &ldquo;setting a course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Anything you can do?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Bob, still crouching beside him.&nbsp; The alien didn&rsquo;t answer other than a grim hue coming from his mirror ball before turning back to his console.&nbsp; She noticed that a icosahedron marked &lsquo;Goliath&rsquo; in the CIC was the last remaining Bobbin ship in theatre.&nbsp; Her head sunk in sad acknowledgement of how many Bobbins must have just died alongside her own people, and for how Bob must be feeling about that.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When she looked back at the CIC Kathryn was horrified to see the readout that there was only the Goliath and New Horizon II on the allied side left in the field, but five enemy ships left, four octahedrons and one dodecahedron.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re on to us,&rdquo; Byrne said as they all looked up and saw the remaining ships bearing down on them.&nbsp; They were all on the far side of the blob of shadow matter they were high tailing for.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Goliath reports it has exhausted its supply of antimatter weapons,&rdquo; Bob grimly reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sengupta?&rdquo; Brinkerhoff asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fourteen remaining warheads sir.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob seemed to sigh with the weight of his civilization on his shoulders, and Kathryn put a hand on his shoulder, identifying with him completely in that moment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Goliath will clear the path for you,&rdquo; Bob coldly informed them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get the job done.&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Acknowledged,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff affirmed, understanding.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;New Horizon II fell into formation behind the Goliath, in the shadow of the enemy&rsquo;s weapons fire.&nbsp; They watched as the smaller enemy ships and Goliath exchanged intense volley&rsquo;s of beam weapon&rsquo;s fire.&nbsp; The CIC showed in detail the rapid mass loss of the larger ship as a result, but also showed it penetrating one of the enemy ships and destroying it, then another, evening the odds further.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want a targeting solution on the remaining ships <em>now</em>,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff barked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo; Sengupta called back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tarsus we&rsquo;ll be threading the needle on this one, be ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; the officer called back, his tongue hanging out of his mouth in concentration.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright Bob, count us down.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After a few moments, Bob called out &ldquo;Three&hellip; Two&hellip; One&hellip; <em>Now!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At the signal Tarsus flipped the ship and burned maximum thrust to slow their approach to the shadow matter.&nbsp; At the same time the goliath opened a narrow passageway through its core to allow the target matter to pass through, then reconfigured into a broad shield to take all of the enemy weapon&rsquo;s fire to give New Horizon II a chance to safely decelerate and absorb the matter.&nbsp; They touched the resupply of shield material just as the Goliath exploded, and after quickly flipping the ship around on a parallel vector, New Horizon II fired a full spread of torpedoes at the three remaining enemy ships as they exited the cloud of destruction left in place of the Goliath, then a second volley a few seconds later sending two torpedoes at each ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The new shadow matter replenished their shields, and with evasive maneuvering from Tarsus the enemy ships were only able to manage a few glancing blows before all rapidly vaporizing in sequence one after the other.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The cheers roaring through the bridge were short lived as reality quickly burned through their excitement at the heat of the moment.&nbsp; They had won, but it was a pyrrhic victory.&nbsp; Thousands of comrades both human and Bobbin had died in the battle, dozens of ships. &nbsp;And though they had won, they were alone.&nbsp; A single ship left to finish the job with an unknown number of enemy ships still waiting for them in orbit around their ultimate target.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Congratulations everyone, jobs impeccably done,&rdquo; Kathryn offered as bravely as she could.&nbsp; Full damage and situation reports to my office on the double,&rdquo; she ordered before turning to exit into her office.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She turned and leaned her back against the closed door.&nbsp; Looking up with wide eyes she started gasping for air.&nbsp; Her heart was beating so fast it felt like it was going to explode and she tore apart the collar of her coveralls uniform, rubbing her hands up and down her throat trying to assure her brain that it was indeed unobstructed and she should be able to breathe.&nbsp; Next came the shakes as her gasps for air turned to panicked sobs and she slid down to the ground and crumpled having a full blown panic attack.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They&rsquo;d won but all was lost.&nbsp; What the hell&nbsp; was she supposed to do now?&nbsp; <em>What in the ever loving fuck were they supposed to do now???</em></p>
