            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Over the next few hours Kathryn showed Sirius and Sengupta around the station, showing them all of the critical engineering, research, and command areas, as well as introducing them to all of their new senior staff. &nbsp;That night they had a formal reception dinner and formal transferring of command ceremony with all of the senior staff of the station as well as the ship. &nbsp;Margaret turned out to be the star of the event, since none of the crew of New Horizon II had ever seen or met a simulant before.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;In the morning, Kathryn, Jaren, Maggie, Margaret, and Felix with P4 cautiously plodding along behind, made their way down to the central engineering section, through the long docking prong, and into the ship. &nbsp;It had obviously gotten the spit polish treatment in anticipation of a new command taking over, and everything was gleaming and spotless. &nbsp; The bulkheads were of some strong polymer material, but they looked like they were bright but dirty white porcelain, and it gave the ship a remarkably bright and welcoming feel to it. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Welcomed by the senior staff, they then went to their respective quarters to put away the things they&rsquo;d brought with them. &nbsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s room was in no way the luxurious and spacious suite she&rsquo;d had on the station. &nbsp; In fact the reality that she had her own room was the luxury her rank afforded her. &nbsp;Most of the others had to bunk four to a room to save space in the area of the ship with simulated gravity.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The ship had a standard crew compliment of twenty four, so space was limited for any extra personnel. &nbsp;Kathryn and Jaren would share the commanding officer&rsquo;s suite, and Felix would share the traditional first officer&rsquo;s suite with Maggie. &nbsp;Simulants were originally built with the need to sleep, but only to fully simulate the human experience. &nbsp;Since being reborn in her new body though, Margaret had conducted several hacks to her systems she kept a certain mysteriousness about what exactly she had done. &nbsp;She referred to them as upgrades, and the only one they knew for sure was the elimination of her need to sleep, though she retained the capacity to simulate it if she felt the desire to. &nbsp;As such she had declined a designated sleeping area for herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Having settled in, the convened on the bridge to conduct their departure from the station. &nbsp; Working on the station, Kathryn sometimes forgot how beautifully the Kobolians could construct the interior of ships. &nbsp;Stepping onto the bridge took her breath away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Although it was located in the core of the forward section of the ship, it appeared from the inside to be a transparent perfect sphere. &nbsp;This was an elaborate illusion though of course. &nbsp;The top three quarters of the apparent sphere were perfect display screens, on which external cameras projected what could be seen outside. &nbsp; Below this was a floor which created the same effect. &nbsp;To step onto the bridge it was impossible to tell without knowing better that one was in a mere soap bubble floating in space. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was possible to make the rest of the ship appear in a ghostly transparent way to be able to judge distances and for docking, but for now it was set to complete transparency, and a couple dozen meters to their left they could see the open docking port of the Orbital One prong, seemingly connected to nothing, and the massive station looming beyond it, all dwarfed by the bright blue and white planet beyond.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn floated her way over to the central captain&rsquo;s seat which could swivel completely around to be able to see all about the ship, and strapped herself in, and watched as Jaren, Felix, and Margaret all did the same thing at the half dozen multi-purpose stations surrounding her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Disengage docking clamps,&rdquo; Kathryn ordered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Disengaging docking clamps,&rdquo; Jaren called back as he tapped at the glass panel in front of him to conduct the operation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret sighed heavily. &nbsp;&ldquo;I really miss thought control,&rdquo; she lamented.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I believe they built the receiving technology into this ship, that&rsquo;s the super easy part of the technology. &nbsp;They should have done it so that the ship is ready when we do have breakthroughs in that technology. &nbsp;That should mean that you can access the systems by thought control.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret closed her eyes, and the rest of the ship came into ghostly semi-transparent view about them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well how do you like that?&rdquo; she mused. &nbsp;&ldquo;How novel.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re having fun Margaret,&rdquo; Kathryn said as she tapped at her own consoles to resume the full transparency of the ship. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pilot, take us away from the prong easy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes admiral,&rdquo; the young woman answered. &nbsp;She then did just that, activating the appropriate control thrusters to push them gently out of reach of the prong.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn touched her panel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Orbital One, this is New Horizon II. &nbsp;We have disengaged and are ready to conduct our first burn towards the sun.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Acknowledged New Horizon II,&rdquo; they heard Sirius&rsquo; voice say over the comm channel. &nbsp; &ldquo;Good luck and safe journey.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was the standard well wishing to a departing ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Kathryn answered before closing the channel. &nbsp;She then opened a ship wide broadcast channel. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are conducting our first burn. &nbsp;This is final warning to brace yourself.&rdquo; &nbsp;She had already checked that Maggie was safely secured in the astrometrics secondary observation room, built like the bridge in the transparent bubble sense. &nbsp;It was much smaller thought, designed for four people to very easily zoom in on different parts of the sky and virtually draw on the cosmos to determine positions, orbits, and relative speeds of all manner of celestial bodies for the sake of navigation. &nbsp;For everyone else on the ship, the burn protocols were second nature.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Pilot, whenever you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The acceleration crept up on them as the engines brought them up from a relative standstill, but picked up quickly and remained constant. &nbsp;This was the trade-off of having such a fast ship. &nbsp; Speed is relative in space, and fast means being able to accelerate faster, which makes normal operating on the ship more difficult. &nbsp;So, they would burn for several hours, then take a brief break of normally a half an hour or so for everyone to conduct whatever business they needed to without the acceleration, then the warning would go out again for everyone to strap in again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The first half day was spent breaking out of Earth&rsquo;s orbit, then the energy was spent in a direction which both slowed their velocity in their orbit around the sun to fall inward, as well as to a lesser degree driving directly down towards the star. &nbsp; It was a balancing act. &nbsp;Slowing your orbit fell you in towards the sun, but do so too much, and you then have to expend extra energy to speed up in your orbit again to avoid simply falling into the sun. &nbsp;Burning directly towards the sun ran the same risk. &nbsp;Plus there was the issue of needing to match orbits with the giant magenta crystal at the heart of the rift system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ultimately the idea was to let gravity do most of the work for you, but to give gravity an assist as intelligently as possible. &nbsp;You never win fighting against gravity, but you can save a lot of energy if you use it and try to help it help you accomplish what you want. &nbsp;As a result their burns were intermittent, occurring more in the early days, and lesser and lesser as the trip went on as they more and more merely needed to adjust their orbital approach as they fell towards the star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn, Jaren, and Felix coordinated on trying to provide a duty roster for Maggie which was stimulating, as well as challenging without risking overwhelming her. &nbsp; The truth was though, there wasn&rsquo;t much to do in this phase of the mission. &nbsp;The real hard work and long hours would be when they began taking in a tsunami of observational data on the other side which would need to be processed. &nbsp; In the end they wound up giving her a fair amount of work which would ordinarily be other crew people&rsquo;s regular maintenance and diagnostics tasks and giving those technicians the day off, at which they were happy to oblige.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret of course, was bored, and did her assigned duties with such disinterest they rather stopped trying. &nbsp;She spent most of her time tormenting poor P4 in the lab he was set up in under the guise of helping Felix work on him en route during this slow phase of the mission. &nbsp; Kathryn and Jaren themselves found themselves enjoying this comparative down time, feeling quite justified in doing so knowing how much work was waiting for them on the other side, and how hard they had worked on the station all those years. &nbsp;Aside for the intermittent burns which immobilized them at their stations, everyone was having a remarkably relaxing time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they got nearer and nearer the star, they became ever more consciously appreciative of the sophisticated magnetic shield which deflected all the otherwise lethal particle storm raged against them by the unrelenting nuclear blowtorch they were getting ever nearer. &nbsp;All interstellar ships had backups as well as redundant backups since the ships were designed to regularly fly directly into the barely contained fiery hellscape. &nbsp; Eventually though, the massive kilometer wide crystal came into view, and this leg of their journey was almost over.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They approached with all due caution, and when at the appropriate range they signalled the array of solar collectors which swarmed the star like locust to unfurl their collectors and begin streaming all that power up to secondary collectors, then to the four massive tertiary collectors, which then all simultaneously pounded the crystal with blinding pillars of light, causing the molecular structure of the crystal to explode, &nbsp;This caused the crystal to expand into a violet energy rift which served as the event horizon for one side of a temporarily stable artificial wormhole. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was hard to notice between how blinding the final pillars of light were by comparison, and how darkly filtered their view of the sun had to be to safely observe it, but the star darkened considerably with the swarm of solar collectors all absorbing so much of its energy and blocking its output in their unfurled state. &nbsp; The effect was so dramatic, that everyone on Earth on the day time side noticed immediately when the sun eerily darkened whenever transit was initiated from this side of the rift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It would only stay open for a few minutes, and could not be activated again for hours afterwards so their timing was critical, but their crew was expert and experienced. &nbsp; Thirty seconds after the rift formed, the New Horizon sailed through.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It didn&rsquo;t seem to take any time to make their way through the rift, they merely all felt the now familiar disorientating shudder and momentary rush of colours which always accompanied the moment of passing through. &nbsp;Someone had tried to explain to Kathryn the cause of the effect, but in the end she could only really understand the analogy of the field of the rift causing the brain to hiccup in a way. &nbsp;In any case they assured her it was safe and there had yet to be any evidence to the contrary.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They emerged from the rift on the other side, and as per protocol, full safe thrust was applied away from the star and in increase of their orbital velocity to enlarge their orbit and pull away from the star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her head pressed against the back of her head rest, Kathryn reached out to touch the comm channel and open a ship wide broadcast channel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 61 Cygni. &nbsp;We are the first life to ever be in this system. &nbsp;I think that warrants some reverence. &nbsp;You should all take a moment on that.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;</p>
