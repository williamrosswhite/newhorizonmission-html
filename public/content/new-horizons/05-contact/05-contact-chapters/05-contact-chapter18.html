            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took three weeks to reach the star again. &nbsp;They were travelling at one and a half gee which while not oppressive was not optimally comfortable either. &nbsp;One hardly felt the strain for shorter periods, but over weeks it added up. &nbsp; People spent more and more time off their feet, and generally seemed more and more fatigued as the stretch went by. &nbsp; They could have gone faster, but with higher acceleration for such a prolongued length of time there was a greater chance of medical problems occurring, underlying conditions brought about prematurely by the strain</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Something like the blue giant star they were ebraced by was so massive and luminescent, that the planet they&rsquo;d been in orbit around was over three hundred times further from the star than Earth was around Sol. &nbsp;The size and power of the star however also meant that the rift system satellites (or whatever the buider&rsquo;s equivalent were) were likewise quite far out from the star, about a hundred AU. &nbsp;That still meant that they had to cover about two hundred AU, the equivalent of flying clear across the solar system five times. &nbsp;Even with the assistance of the massive star&rsquo;s gravity, they maintained an effective one and a half gee.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The weeks dragged on, and although the crew fought boredom, they so often found themselves out in one of the observation decks where Ralph&rsquo;s primary weapon hadn&rsquo;t blown away the polymer glass. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d spend hours staring into that brilliant blue star protected by automatically polarizing and darkening clear material. &nbsp;It was hypnotic, not only the marvellous colour, but this in conjunction with their marvel at how different it was from anything they knew. &nbsp;All of their worlds were around similar stars, even the binary system they first visited when this bizarre and unexpected odyssey had begun, the stars were not too different from their own.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But this goliath hushed them in reverence. &nbsp;It had over twenty times the mass of the sun, and was blue because of how much hotter it was. &nbsp; It had long ago eaten up most of their hydrogen and turned it into helium like the stars they were familiar with, but this beast was so massive it then just started eating the helium and turning it into carbon and oxygen. &nbsp;Before too long, on a cosmological scale anyways, it would eat all the helium it could too, and then who knows what. &nbsp;She knew some specialists onboard probably knew, but before Jaren&rsquo;s people came along science on her planet Haven had just barely figured out the relationship between electricity and magnetism after forgetting so much which their founders knew.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She just stared at the star. &nbsp;Someone told her that in its various phases a star like that could only last seven hundred thousand years or so after leaving it&rsquo;s long stable main sequence phase and finally dying into&hellip; what, a neutron star someone had suggested? &nbsp;Or was it a black hole, whatever those were&hellip; &nbsp;It sure was pretty though. &nbsp;She wondered what seven hundred thousand years were to a species who had been around for millions of years.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It occurred to her that life couldn&rsquo;t have evolved on the planet they&rsquo;d been in orbit around. &nbsp;Before the star turned it would have been a barren ice ball, which then made her wonder what planets had been eaten by the star when it bloated up as it had, and at what point the builders had decided to build a facility here. &nbsp;Had they waited for this new phase in the star? &nbsp; Did they find it this way and decide there was still enough time for it to be useful? &nbsp;Would either side of their civil war be friendly to them? &nbsp;Would they even be able to communicate with beings so advanced?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;So many questions&hellip; and when she was lucky the idle astrophysics questions preoccupied her. &nbsp; When she was unlucky, which was far more often, she thought of her daughter. &nbsp;She spent a lot more time than she was proud of crying alone and feeling more powerless than she ever had in her life. &nbsp;Jaren helped though. &nbsp;Several times he&rsquo;d found her like that when she&rsquo;d been trying to hide it. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t say anything but instead just sat or lay beside her and held her as they both cried and occasionally told each other they&rsquo;d get her back, while both knowing full well there was a better chance she was already dead than still alive.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Finally, they arrived at the rift portal after three agonizingly long weeks. &nbsp;Ralph&rsquo;s avatar body had been repaired, but he had never asked to be put back into it. &nbsp;Kathryn wondered if he wasn&rsquo;t able to both be the ship&rsquo;s computer and operate the robot as well, or if he was just happy to be back in a role he&rsquo;d been built for and simply had no interest in anything else in life.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you zoom in on their portal point?&rdquo; Kathryn asked the operations officer.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The six screen bridge wall panel zoomed in from their standard view which at this point was just a full wall of roiling blue with a small speck they were sailing towards. &nbsp; As the image changed she wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what she was looking at. &nbsp;Her own people&rsquo;s portal system operated by pouring energy into a purple rift crystal which caused it&rsquo;s quantum structure to explode into a rift in space which they could travel through to a similarly treated crystal around another star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;What she was looking at now appeared to be a cube, and a massive one at that. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren how bit is that thing?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He tapped at his science station several times. &nbsp;&ldquo;Big,&rdquo; he proclaimed with a raised eyebrow. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect cube ninety three point eight six kilometers wide long and deep.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she looked more closely she noticed that it had a purple hue to it and she wondered if her colour perception was being distorted by the wash of blue behind it. &nbsp; She opened a channel to Ralph.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ralph is this your builder&rsquo;s rift facility?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Yes</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely unfamiliar. &nbsp;Does it have collecting satellites like ours which feed it energy?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>No, it draws energy from the sun but stores it internally. &nbsp;It can open up to ten successive portals without intervening recharge but then requires days to fully recharge</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren switched off the channel from his own console. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kat we can just barely contain the three yottawatts channelled through our satellites directly onto our crystals and the system damn near burns out every time. &nbsp;I &nbsp; can&rsquo;t imagine the kind of energy system which can store and release that kind of energy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren, you realize that closing the channel just means turning off his voice but that he can hear us regardless right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man chuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right&hellip;&rdquo; he offered with some good natured embarrassment and reopened the channel for her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After a lingering smile at him, she then asked Ralph: &ldquo;Alright, so how do we activate and enter?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Leave it to me</em>,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; she said, irritated anew at having no control over her own ship, &ldquo;what can we expect when we cross over?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Unknown. &nbsp;There is obviously some kind of turmoil with the builders. &nbsp;I will send a signal ahead of us identifying myself, situation, and intentions, but all of this could be construed as a possible rouse by the enemy if there is indeed a conflict. &nbsp;If the system is still the capital, I expect a strong military presence on the other side.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that should be interesting to see,&rdquo; Margaret offered dryly from behind them. &nbsp; The rest were on zero gee and strapped in their seats as they approached on inertia alone, but Kathryn noticed Margaret appeared to be standing under gravity, though her hair was appropriately floating about her head. &nbsp;The simulant noticed Kathryn looking down at her feet in puzzlement at the lack of magnetic gravity boots despite the initiated effect. &nbsp;Margaret lifted one foot off the ground and rapped her knuckles against the sole of her casual shoes and merely offered: &ldquo;upgrades.&rdquo; as an explanation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn soundlessly mouthed &ldquo;ahh&hellip;&rdquo; and returned her attention. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren, I&rsquo;m going to need a situation report as soon as you can get it to me once we&rsquo;re through. &nbsp;Ships, sizes, configurations, energy readings, everything.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You got it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Paschal, we&rsquo;re going to be relying on Ralph to translate and convey our intentions at first and maybe for some time, but you&rsquo;re our best linguist onboard. &nbsp;I want you to follow along and make of it what you can. &nbsp;The more we can do on our own the better.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn opened up a shipwide broadcast. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay people we&rsquo;re headed through, be ready for anything. &nbsp;If we&rsquo;re still alive tomorrow drinks are on me.&rdquo; &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t sure when she&rsquo;d taken on such a macabre tone, but the dark humour seemed to lighten the tension. &nbsp;At least she hoped so. &nbsp;Laughing in the face of death seemed to make it&rsquo;s likelihood less scary somehow.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay Ralph, we&rsquo;re ready. &nbsp;Take us in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The bridge crew watched as the surface the massive cube which was facing them seemed to shift and shimmer as they approached. &nbsp;It phased as if it was somehow simultaneously there and not there. &nbsp; Nothing seemed to appear behind it though, which only enhanced the oddity of the effect.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They drew nearer and nearer, until the entirety of their field of view was the near surface of the cube, and the twisty turny uncertainty of the surface came into closer and closer view bur revealed no further detail. &nbsp;The surface seemed to ripple and swirl in ethereal eddies which defied comprehension. &nbsp;It made the mind hurt to look at it as it tried desperately to make sense of what it was seeing but could find absolutely no parallel to equate it to.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After what seemed like an eon, their surface finally touched the uncertain surface, and the event horizon washed over the ship front to back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn was completely unprepared for the effect. &nbsp;She was used to everything her senses told her to be washed out for several moments as though rift travel overloaded her brain or sensory systems of something. &nbsp; This travel was so much smoother, to the point that her senses hardly noticed. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the forward array passed through the portal it immediately began depicting on the bridge screens what it saw on the other side, a starry night with some objects distant she couldn&rsquo;t make out without any zoon. &nbsp;But then the forward view screen was swallowed by the eccentric surface of the cube and she had a deep sense of existential dread as it swept towards her, swallowing up the bridge before it finally consumed her as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Once on the other side though everything felt normal, and looking behind her she could see the same wave of anomalous force sweep to the rear of the bridge and disappear behind the rear bulkhead. &nbsp;Jaren appeared unusually concerned as it washed over him, his knuckles white from how hard he was gripping his chair. &nbsp;Margaret of course, was making a point of looking as nonchalant as possible to the others, perfectly timing the lighting of her cigar to the moment the wave passed over her. &nbsp;Sometimes she could be too much, Kathryn reflected with amusement before turning the full force of her attention to the situation at hand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Report,&rdquo; she ordered as calmly as possible.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; I need a minute,&rdquo; Jaren pleaded. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ops?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a furious amount of comm activity between us and one of the ships out there, Ralph must be trying to assure them we&rsquo;re no threat and explaining his and our situation.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Best not disturb him then. &nbsp;What else can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I can tell you the star is a yellow dwarf like we&rsquo;re used to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn bobbed her head to the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s always good to know I guess. &nbsp;Jaren?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I read over a thousand ships out there&hellip; energy readings just right off the scale. &nbsp; What&rsquo;s really puzzling me&hellip; at first I thought it was a trick they were playing on our instruments, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all platonic solids!&rdquo; &nbsp;He seemed like he just couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Every ship I look at is either a perfect tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron of icosahedron,&rdquo; he marvelled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Also of note, none are too big to fit through the cube we just entered. &nbsp; Some by just a hair&rsquo;s width, and I do mean that literally, but every one of them can transit. &nbsp;Also&hellip; yeah, looks like the bigger the ship is the more complex the shapes. &nbsp;Little ships roughly our size are tetrahedrons and the ones that would just barely make it through the portal are the twenty faced icosahedrons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ok, well that&rsquo;s&hellip; unexpected.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn remarked. &nbsp;She then opened a channel to Felix in engineering. &nbsp;&ldquo;Catch all that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I did Kat.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What configuration were our attacker&rsquo;s ships again?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tetrahedron. &nbsp; They penetrated our hull with one of the points.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; Anything to report down there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nope, all our systems same as they were.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thanks Felix.&rdquo; &nbsp; She closed the channel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ops, same comm traffic?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slowed down some Captain, I&rsquo;m now getting longer pauses between transmission bursts. &nbsp; I&rsquo;d guess they&rsquo;re conferring back with an authority further away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, okay well let&rsquo;s give him the time he needs then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As though on cue, Ralph spoke to her over the comms. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>I have made contact</em>.&rdquo; he stated plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn waited a few moments before asking: &ldquo;and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>They are provisionally accepting my explanation, and are checking back with the capital planet for confirmation before proceeding. &nbsp; It will take up to fifteen of your minutes now for a response.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>If our arrangement is approved, a research vessel staffed with investigators and diplomats will be dispatched from one of the ships and they will approach the New Horizon II and board it. &nbsp;They will examine the ship and crew to determine definitively that we are not a rouse by their enemy to infiltrate the capital, until then we are ordered to enter a parking orbit around the star until this vessel arrives, and if we do not follow their orders we will immediately be destroyed.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Margaret observed between puffs on her cigar. &nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly could be worse. &nbsp;At least they didn&rsquo;t <em>open</em> with destroying us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;True.&rdquo; Kathryn agreed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain Barnes, I would like to resume operation of the robot. &nbsp;I consider my mission complete now. &nbsp;I am willing to leave my core connected to New Horizon II to function in place of your lost core, but I am returning all control to your people.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s mood noticeably brightened and she shot a &lsquo;well how bout that&rsquo; look at Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes of course, thank you Ralph. &nbsp;You may join us on the bridge when you are ready. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to know everything you can tell us before the alien ship arrives. &nbsp; Pilot, put us in a parking orbit around the star please. &nbsp;No fancy gee manoeuvers, just put us in orbit and park there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The aperture they had exited was of course itself in orbit, so the pilot just had to put a safe distance between them and it and leave the ship as it was. &nbsp;This produced minute accelerations this way and that, but otherwise they were all left in the absence of gravity.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked Jaren and Margaret.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dead,&rdquo; Margaret offered with a impassive shrug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s a start.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is that,&rdquo; Jaren affirmed with an eye roll.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren we&rsquo;ve got some time here, I want you to pour over the sensor and comm logs, see if all of the extra data we&rsquo;ve collected in conjunction with access to Ralphs fundamental core processing can get you any closer to figuring out how to operate this portal system on our own.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;On it.&rdquo; &nbsp; He turned his chair back around and started working at his control panel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Something tells me these aren&rsquo;t the people who took Maggie,&rdquo; Margaret offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;They seemed to have zero interest in talking.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded. &nbsp; She agreed but hadn&rsquo;t wanted to be the first to say it for fear of it just being wishful thinking. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the shapes of those ships though?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they use propulsion anything like the way we do. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t care what they&rsquo;re made of, with the kind of gees they were pulling to get back to the blue star from that planet as they did, if they&rsquo;re still organic they&rsquo;d be liquefied against the wall.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what do they use?&rdquo; Margaret asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not a clue, something I can&rsquo;t even fathom. &nbsp;But, our ships are all built around the propulsion system being at the back of the ship. &nbsp;If you could just move around by magic, there would be no front or rear of the ship, no port or starboard, so there&rsquo;d be no need for any irregularity to the shape, hence the regular shapes. &nbsp;Just a guess.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that point, Felix and Ralph in robot form entered the bridge. &nbsp;Ralph had built in magnets like Margaret had apparently had installed in herself, and Felix was wearing boots that produced the same effect, allowing both of them to walk onto the bridge in the absence of gravity with relative ease.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright Ralph, spill. &nbsp;Tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There has been a schism between the builders. &nbsp;There are two factions. &nbsp;This faction did not take your computer core and daughter. &nbsp;They do not know why we were attacked.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What was the schism over?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I did not ask. &nbsp; It was not relevant.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Kathryn answered with a sigh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are they going to help us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I did not ask.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; What <em>did</em> your conversation consist of?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I transmitted the entirety of my logs, and they asked for clarification about a great many things and I answered to the best of my ability. &nbsp;They accepted my story provisionally pending confirmation, and issued instructions.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And that was it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sighed. &nbsp; &ldquo;Well, thanks for your help&hellip; I wish you could have thought to probe further on our behalf.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is not my function. &nbsp;It is however the function of the emissaries they are sending. &nbsp;Of them you can ask anything you wish and they will answer as they see fit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Also&hellip; thank <em>you</em> for allowing me to complete my mission.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what now for you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What would have become of you if you&rsquo;d have succeeded in your original mission?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I would have been integrated into the new portal system and served as its central computer core.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sounds lonely,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; the robot remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Receiving transmission Captain, audio only,&rdquo; the operations officer reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Put it on please.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Star Fleet vessel New Horizon II. &nbsp;What follows is contingent on the drone ship unit&rsquo;s accuracy. &nbsp;We regret that first contact between was hostility from our rival faction. &nbsp;This conflict is an exception to millennia as a peaceful species. &nbsp;A vessel has been dispatched to survey your ship and crew to ensure your appearance here is not subterfuge by our enemy. &nbsp;Once your nature and intentions are confirmed you will be welcomed to the capital planet for formal contact. &nbsp;Please accommodate docking with your vessel. &nbsp;If you make any manoeuvers we view as threatening, you will be destroyed. &nbsp; Please acknowledge to any of the ships before you.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, I guess you don&rsquo;t need me,&rdquo; Paschal noted.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The report I transmitted included details on your language,&rdquo; Ralph informed them. &nbsp;&ldquo;It is not complicated.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret looked the robot up and down and then blew a puff of smoke into its digitized face. &nbsp; &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re insulted Kat.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn simultaneously rolled her eyes and shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ops, transmit this on the same channel please. &nbsp;Simply &lsquo;we understand and are standing by&rsquo;.&rdquo; &nbsp;She looked at the others. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think anything else can be said once they arrive. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d hate to say something that could be misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am&hellip; picking up a ship. &nbsp;It is a&hellip; tetrahedron.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Margaret offered dryly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And it is&hellip; wow. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re speed is&hellip; impossible.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we thought when we were attacked,&rdquo; Felix explained.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ten gee&hellip; twelve gee&hellip; <em>fifteen</em> gee&hellip; wow, twenty, twenty-five&hellip; wont&rsquo; take them that long at this rate. &nbsp;Ralph what&rsquo;s the maximum acceleration of a craft like that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thirty two point eight of your gees for a vessel that small.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The bigger ones go faster?&rdquo; Felix boggled.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ralph answered, seemingly not understanding their amazement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, then at that rate they should be here in just a few minutes,&rdquo; Jaren told them. &nbsp; &ldquo;Like, we should be hustling down to the airlock soon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Nobody had expected things to happen that quickly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right, okay then,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ops, you have the bridge, Jaren, Maggie, Felix, Ralph and I are going to go greet our guests.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain.&rdquo;</p>
