            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re not a politician?&rdquo; former President Sato asked her as she took her hand afterwards as those who had power to exercise went to their corners to discuss what they&rsquo;d just heard. &nbsp;&ldquo;You give a hell of a campaign speech,&rdquo; she offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The woman easily had 20 years on her but was as sharp as she remembered from the first day they&rsquo;d met some 15 years ago after Kathryn had making unexpected first contact with Jaren and the Koboli and been ushered to the presidential residence after returning to Earth.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well thanks, but only because I really believe what I said. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all the lying, empty promises, and pretending to like people you hate that makes me loathe the idea.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Sato looked down and smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; she conceded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Walk with me?&rdquo; she asked, though it was more than a request and Kathryn acceded. &nbsp;The heavy bulkhead doors opened as they approached, and once through the security check station and past another set of doors they entered onto the main concourse of the station. &nbsp;The floor gently sloped up and away beneath the ceiling in both directions and they turned left, beginning their walk around the rotational gravity ring. &nbsp;Kathryn looked up at the balconies on either side, at all of the shuttered storefronts and wondered what it would have been like to have been here at the height of their civilization on Earth, bustling with activity and interplay between countless sub cultures from across the globe.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is all that,&rdquo; Sato acknowledged, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not just that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Madam President?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Politics. &nbsp;I imagine you have a strong distaste of inauthenticity that makes you so averse. &nbsp;Would it surprise you I share this sentiment?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She thought about it for a moment before answering: &ldquo;I suppose it would.&rdquo; &nbsp;The woman was no longer her superior and it granted her some latitude for honesty. &nbsp;I suppose I didn&rsquo;t ever think to stop at you when it came to my opinion of politicians.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And rightly so. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve certainly had to do my share of lying and deceiving. &nbsp;And while yes there are some who are far too comfortable with it, some of us recognize it as a necessary evil to do good. &nbsp;You might be surprised what couldn&rsquo;t be accomplished if one could never lie, or at least&hellip; bend the truth.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Kathryn said, deliberately conveying her skepticism. &nbsp;She was wondering when the woman would get to the point.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Be not afraid of greatness. &nbsp;Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hasanabi?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Definitely sounds familiar.&rdquo; &nbsp;Hasanabi was one of their earlier revered writers from soon after their arrival on Haven.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Shakespeare actually. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s been quite a revival of appreciation of his work on Haven since you retrieved the original New Horizon&rsquo;s archives. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not surprised it feels familiar even if you haven&rsquo;t heard it said exactly that way. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a sentiment as old as humanity itself Admiral. &nbsp;From the first day our species needed leaders it didn&rsquo;t take us long to realize that those who sought power were the most unfit to wield it, and that those most fit would avoid it. &nbsp;Why do you think that is?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They continued walking at their easy pace for a little while as Kathryn considered the question. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose because they realize what a miserable and thankless job it is.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The gravel in Sato&rsquo;s voice which came from her age became more pronounced as she laughed at her answer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not wrong about that,&rdquo; she nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Though the power hungry don&rsquo;t care about thanks, they only care about power, about having more for themselves and less for everyone else. &nbsp;Though they are typically miserable on the inside in ways they can&rsquo;t explain, they outwardly tend to luxuriate in the trappings of wealth they extract with their power. &nbsp;It is only those even vaguely fit for power could lament their job as such.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Are you going somewhere with this Madame President? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ll forgive me, it won&rsquo;t be long before we&rsquo;ve walked the entire habitat ring and there is much to do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; the older woman said as she left on a tangent and entered one of the abandoned restaurants they were passing. &nbsp;She wiped the dust off of one of the chairs and sat down, inviting Kathryn to join her with an open hand extended to the chair on the opposite side of the small, round table.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn let out a sigh which signaled her dismay the further delay, but was kept within the limits of due respect. &nbsp;Foregoing wiping the chair off, she was content to sit her uniform coveralls on the chair and keep her hands relatively clean.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This could be the end of all things.&rdquo; &nbsp;The way the woman looked at her when she said it made her eyes were more piercing than Kathryn had ever seen. &nbsp;She nodded her agreement. &nbsp;&ldquo;Even if we survive this, nothing will ever be the same. &nbsp;What happened to Kobol&hellip;&rdquo; she didn&rsquo;t need to complete the sentence to be understood, and Kathryn again nodded her understanding. &nbsp;&ldquo;But also this new species you&rsquo;ve befriended. &nbsp;Our conception of ourselves as a species, as a civilization can never be the same again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The old woman sighed. &nbsp;She brought her right hand to her left arm and slowly ran her hand up and down as though to warm herself, but more for a means of comforting herself Kathryn figured, as it was too slow to generate any meaningful heat from friction.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Internally we&rsquo;ll be shattered by Kobol, and shattered by our inevitable heavy losses to come even if we prevail. &nbsp;There will be a power vacuum, not just for repopulation of Kobol, but in the inter colonial power structure. &nbsp;They were the superpower, and now they will be no more. &nbsp;There will be a race to fill that void. &nbsp;Externally the existence of the&hellip; Bobbins, great name by the way, your doing?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shrugged with a half-smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;Had to call them something.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Sato smiled and nodded in agreement for a moment before continuing. &nbsp;Their existence will create an imperative for us to unify more than ever as a common entity in contrast with them. &nbsp;We won&rsquo;t be able to operate as independent colonies having complicated and sometimes even antagonistic relations with the others. &nbsp;Especially with the degree of cooperation you propose with them. &nbsp;Some will worship them and wish away all our humanity to embrace being as like them as we can. &nbsp;Some in their xenophobia will wish to separate us from them as much as possible. &nbsp;Extremists will inevitably seek ways to sabotage our relations, may even seek to kill them, even exterminate them after we&rsquo;ve stolen as much of their technology as possible. &nbsp;Like humans in all places across all time, we will have the power to create in one hand and the power to destroy in the other.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good god&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not even sure if we can survive as a species in this crisis, and you&rsquo;re already planning for the next few!&rdquo; &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was hearing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Sato dismissed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a decorated military officer. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re trained in strategic thinking; you&rsquo;ve studied the history. &nbsp;As soon as a force believes they can win, they immediately begin thinking of how they can create the conditions in their victory to be on the best footing for the next battle, for the next war.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sure, but&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn had nothing to respond with. &nbsp;She was right, but she hadn&rsquo;t thought their current crisis so solvable as to think about positioning after the fact.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re special Admiral Barnes. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not destined by a divine hand. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not burdened with destiny. &nbsp;But some combination of being in the right place at the right times in history, some quirks of your upbringing and experience that have made you both brave and wise, have left you the only person qualified to lead us into whatever future we find ourselves in, if we are to have any future at all. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You were the first to reach New Horizon again. &nbsp;You were the first to make contact with another colony, to go back to Earth, to make contact with an alien species. &nbsp;You may not have thought of it much, but your name has come to carry a lot of weight. &nbsp;You are known. &nbsp;You are respected.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn deflected as she traced a disordered pattern in the layer of dust on the table in front of them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re humble. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t imagine being that kind of leader, of shouldering that much responsibility and wielding that kind of power. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why it has to be you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stood and turned. &nbsp;She slowly walked over to the walls, examining the arcane decorations on the wall, references to cultural touchstones long lost of any significance to anyone who could see them now. &nbsp;She wondered if Sato was like that. &nbsp;She wanted to think the old woman was just crazy. &nbsp;From behind her she said out loud the next thoughts that entered her mind as they did.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If not you it could only be somebody worse.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s head sunk. &nbsp;She knew she was right and in that moment she felt the added crushing weight of what she knew she&rsquo;d need to do. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d met most of the political leadership of the colonies, dined with most of the senior Star Fleet officers. &nbsp;Her respectful deference had in the past allowed her to fail to recognize how much better she was than them. &nbsp;She understood better, could see the bigger picture and the small scale at the same time in ways they were challenged to, could see further into the future as well as the past, could see the context of situations and the deeper meanings of things.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Someone equally capable with selfish motivations, or someone well meaning but less capable, these are the only other options.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned and returned to the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made your point Emily.&rdquo; &nbsp;President Sato&rsquo;s expression flashed of indignance before quickly warming at the significance of Kathryn dropping the pretention of her title. &nbsp;&ldquo;I assume you&rsquo;re not talking about a coup or something.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing so romantic,&rdquo; Sato scoffed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;s next election is next year. &nbsp;If we survive you will run and you will win. &nbsp;You will quickly outshine your counterparts on Roma, Earth, and among the survivors of Kobol. &nbsp;In the face of existing alongside the Bobbins you will lead a push to unify the colonies into a common political structure and you will be nominated to be its first leader and you&rsquo;ll win. &nbsp;While serving your legal term limits you will lay the foundation for our future for hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; Kathryn drolly asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just lucky I&rsquo;m too old to beat you to it,&rdquo; Sato teased with a wink and a wry smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d established I was the unlucky one in this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Only because you don&rsquo;t enjoy the game the way I do. &nbsp;But who knows, play it long enough and you even come to enjoy it despite yourself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well all I can say is you better stick around long enough to help me do all that,&rdquo; Kathryn warned, taking on a far more familiar tone than she ever had with her former Commander in Chief. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare go dying on me before the job&rsquo;s done, you&rsquo;re not <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>that</em> old&hellip;&rdquo; she teased.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned at the sound of footsteps running down the concourse towards them. &nbsp;They weren&rsquo;t the sprint of an emergency, but the jog of urgency. &nbsp;She moved towards the door and looking around the corner met eyes with Margaret.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The children have exhausted themselves,&rdquo; she said, eliciting an amused snort from President Sato. &nbsp;&ldquo;Time to get back.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn found herself in a private room with the top leadership of all interested parties. &nbsp;Bob was there of course, and at her insistence she was accompanied by Margaret and Sato while they all faced off against the current president of Haven and Bishop of Roma, as well as Admiral Brinkerhoff, the most senior surviving member of Koboli leadership available in the system. &nbsp;Earth had not been re colonized and had no formal unified leadership, and it was not the first time Margaret had informally spoken for Earth&rsquo;s interests at times when some such representative was necessary.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Supposing for the moment Mr. Bob that we agree to assist you however we can, what exactly would you ask of us?&rdquo; President Uzodimma asked. &nbsp;The leader of haven was a mocha skinned man with a flat nose and an imposing physicality despite being shorter than Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We only require that you hand over to us all of your supplies of anti-matter and ramp up whatever remaining production capacity you have to maximum,&rdquo; it answered through its mirror ball.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unacceptable,&rdquo; Kathryn stated firmly. &nbsp;Bob&rsquo;s mirror ball flashed a colour which suggested a mixture of confusion and a sense of betrayal. &nbsp;&ldquo;Unacceptable,&rdquo; she repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will not just hand over our only means of defense to you and just send you on your way hoping for the best. &nbsp;If we&rsquo;re in this fight we mean to be <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>in this fight</em>,&rdquo; she clarified, sharply tapping at the table with each syllable for emphasis.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have a long history of warfare to draw on, tactics unknown to your enemies, strategies they wouldn&rsquo;t expect. &nbsp;We might see weaknesses in your plans you&rsquo;re too advanced to.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bob seemed to scoff at the suggestion they could have any weaknesses in their plans humans could recognize. &nbsp;&ldquo;We need to be involved in your battle planning, in how these weapons will be used.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You mentioned our remaining production capacity,&rdquo; Bishop Rosales said, a tall woman with a face worn from age and experience, but with sharp blue eyes that betrayed no weakness. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s negligible, don&rsquo;t even consider it. &nbsp;We only have a few experimental reactors trying to develop domestic anti-matter technology. &nbsp;Only the Koboli had actually mastered it. &nbsp;What we have is what we have.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bob seemed disappointed, but nodded his understanding of the reality. &nbsp;&ldquo;When what we have is gone, it&rsquo;s gone. &nbsp;At least for the purposes of this war.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you propose then?&rdquo; Bob asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Admiral Brinkerhoff exchanged glances. &nbsp;She nodded to offer him first crack at it. &nbsp;&ldquo;This has to end in one go. &nbsp;If you start engaging in subsequent battles using our anti-matter they&rsquo;re going to know where it came from. &nbsp;After the first engagement there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;re going to come and finish the job to be sure to destroy whatever remaining supply lines you may have for it. &nbsp;Hell, they may even just do it out of spite even if they know you have all of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have to attack their central &lt;thing&gt;, where their link is orchestrated,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob shook his head and its mirror ball flashed frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;It is too heavily guarded. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t have enough ships to mount such an attack. &nbsp;To have any chance of success it would leave too many other positions unacceptably vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Brinkerhoff looked at each other again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>we&rsquo;ve</em> got ships,&rdquo; Kathryn said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yours didn&rsquo;t fare too well when it came up against us,&rdquo; Bob said. &nbsp;Kathryn wasn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;d meant to be as snide as he&rsquo;d come off. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then augment them,&rdquo; she demanded. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen what your shadow matter can do, there must be some way you can augment our ships in such a way that we could hang in the fight long enough to make a difference, a way to spread your forces out more advantageously.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob paused. &nbsp;His eye stalks looked down and he appeared to be considering options. &nbsp;&ldquo;Such a thing could be possible,&rdquo; it said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; it hedged. &nbsp;We could probably find a way to innervate the shadow matter into the structure of your ships. &nbsp;Its function in such a configuration would be limited, but it could make a difference. &nbsp;It could enhance your propulsion and maneuverability, shielding&hellip; &nbsp;But it would take time to make the modifications and build a control interface. &nbsp;How many ships do you have?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A few New Horizon II class ships,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff answered, &ldquo;a couple almost completed construction that could be rushed to service. &nbsp;A couple dozen older ships that can still fight between our original separate fleets.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That could be enough&hellip;&rdquo; Bob considered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;d need to bring crews to you with the required supply of shadow matter. &nbsp;We also need to figure out a way to deploy your warheads. &nbsp;Your missiles as they are can easily be shot down by Bobbin weapons. &nbsp;We will want to dismantle all of them and use the raw supply of anti-matter to incorporate into our own missiles, even smaller bullet type projectiles with a smaller amount. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll stretch the supply we have as wide as we can and supply all of the ships in our combined armada with them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Be straight with us Bob,&rdquo; Margaret demanded in an uncharacteristically sincere tone. &nbsp;&ldquo;This a fight we can actually win?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This remains unclear,&rdquo; it answered matter of factly. &nbsp;&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve told you before, my people have largely resigned themselves to the idea that it is a war we cannot win and have been preparing to abandon the galaxy altogether as a result. &nbsp;To win this war it would require sacrificing our chances to do so. &nbsp;It would mean recalling our transport ships and reconfiguring them to warships, devoting everything we have. &nbsp;I will need to return to my home world to make the case for this plan. &nbsp;If we commit to it, it can only end either total victory, or complete annihilation.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;For both of us,&rdquo; Kathryn reminded him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead,text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren looked around at all of the Bobbins working on the New Horizon II bridge rushing their upgrades into service. &nbsp;A small fleet of shadow matter vessels had come through the rift with support engineers and once they&rsquo;d arrived at Orbital One they&rsquo;d begun integrating the technology into the human vessels.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Those that were nearing completion looked strange, as though the ship had been phased and flying through a cloud of the stuff but gotten fused with it half way through. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t encase the ship, but had odd protusions and domes of matter extending from the hull. &nbsp;At a minimum the human ships were all equipped with a weapons array which could do some light damage to enemy shadow matter ships as a defensive backup to their antimatter weapons, and engines at the rear which allowed the ships to travel fast enough that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive the accelerations if the ships were not likewise outfitted with inertial dampening systems. &nbsp;Several of the domes of shadow matter where shield generators which would project the material into a shell around the ship if necessary, but more effectively create a thicker shield between the ship and whatever what shooting at it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn could tell how uncomfortable seeing the aliens everywhere made Jaren. &nbsp;He was aware that they were helping, giving them the capacity to take the fight to his enemies, but they were also in a sense his enemies themselves. &nbsp;&ldquo;Office?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren nodded and the two left the bridge through the doorway to her private office. &nbsp;When the door closed behind the, Kathryn turned and leaned back and half sat on the desk, holding herself up by her palms. &nbsp;&ldquo;It must be tough for you seeing them all here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t them,&rdquo; he answered with flat affect.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kathryn sighed as she looked down. &nbsp;She wanted to pry, wanted to get into a conversation about how he was feeling which neither of them were ready or willing to have. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d known each other intimately long enough that most of it needn&rsquo;t be said out loud. &nbsp; He&rsquo;d always had a xenophobic nationalist streak which made him inclined to dislike the Bobbins in general and made it difficult for him to separate out different factions of such an alien group. &nbsp;But he was also an incredibly bright man who understood all the relevant realities well enough and was disciplined enough to listen to that voice in his head when in control of himself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want a ship,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;His tone was almost one of shame. &nbsp;He knew it was obvious why he wanted to lead one of the attack ships, and equally as obvious why it was a bad idea.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well no,&rdquo; Kathryn stated with as little ambiguity as she could. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get that out of the way right now.&rdquo; &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t seem sad or angry as much as resigned. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t take you out of the fight; that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair either.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He looked up at her quizzically. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to war. &nbsp;I need my XO.&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren&rsquo;s lower lip pursed and he nodded slowly with thought as he looked down and past her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, looking up at her eyes again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;I can do that.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay then. &nbsp;Welcome back.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He walked over and took her in his arms, hugging tightly and gently rocking side to side like they often did before this all started. &nbsp;She hesitated before putting her arms on his back and hugging back, but then indulged in the ancient comfort the embrace still provided.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I guess we have a lot to talk about when this is all over,&rdquo; she heard him say over her shoulder.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We do.&rdquo; she affirmed. &nbsp;&ldquo;But it can all wait until after.&rdquo; &nbsp;He pulled back and nodded. &nbsp;His eyes were wet, but tears handn&rsquo;t breached his eyelids before he wiped the moisture away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is it fair for us to go into battle together?&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean for Maggie. &nbsp;If our ship gets taken out she&rsquo;ll be an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t succeed no one will survive,&rdquo; Kathryn pointed out, to which Jaren nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Anything in between, we-&rdquo; she cut herself off, but too late. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have family who can take care of her.&rdquo; &nbsp;The reminder of his entire extended family being killed shook Jaren for a moment but he shook it off.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he softly answered. &nbsp;After a long mournful sigh, he stiffened his posture as he stood straight and slowly brought his hand to his head in formal salute. &nbsp;&ldquo;Orders, Captain.&rdquo; &nbsp;He was signaling that all the rest could wait, that he was ready to get to work and entrusting himself once again to her authority.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want you to oversee the construction of the control interface between our systems and theirs. &nbsp;Make sure they&rsquo;re actually usable for us, and make sure our personnel know how to use them. &nbsp;Drill them Jaren, I want primary users able to do it in their sleep, but I want everyone else who might have to take over to be familiar with them as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes sir. &nbsp;Anything else?&rdquo; &nbsp;He was never so formal with her in private. &nbsp;She figured he must be holding onto himself incredibly tightly. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She approached to stand closer to him. &nbsp;He was decimeter taller than her and she had to look up at his forward facing eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Would you tell me if you weren&rsquo;t up for this Jaren?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He looked down. &nbsp;&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; he assured her. &nbsp;It was convincing enough. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; he added. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an officer.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I believe you. &nbsp;But Jaren I swear to god the moment you go off book&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;His expression and tone became that of her husband. &nbsp;&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen Kathryn,&rdquo; he assured her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m solid.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get to work.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was small and reflexive, but he smiled for the first time in a long time before turning and exiting the office. &nbsp;As the door opened she saw Felix and Bob at the doorway waiting to speak to her and she motioned them in with her hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Three cruisers and eleven frigates,&rdquo; Bob reported, &ldquo;all being outfitted with shadow matter augments.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all ugly bitches,&rdquo; Felix described with a mixture of disgust and admiration, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re bitches with teeth.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Kathryn nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;We need teeth more than we need beauty queens out there. &nbsp;Any problems?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Surprisingly few actually,&rdquo; Felix answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean it will take us years to understand exactly what they&rsquo;ve done to our ships and would have taken decades to figure out how to do all this ourselves even with all the shadow matter we wanted, gut with Bob&rsquo;s engineers it&rsquo;s been quick work.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The hard part was figuring out how to integrate it into such a primitive technological substrate,&rdquo; Bob said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Felix looked at each other with a note of amusement. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re insulted,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Will it be enough?&rsquo; &nbsp;Kathryn asked Bob.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That remains unclear,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;Our best estimates are that the addition of your ships, the loss of three of ours as shadow matter donors, and the fleet we can bring to bear, we will still be outnumbered three to one if we attempt an attack on the link&rsquo;s central plexus. &nbsp;The addition of anti-matter weapons makes it possible, but not assured.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stretching the anti-matter as far as we can,&rdquo; Felix said, &ldquo;but even with it things are lining up to be basically a coin flip as to whether we can pull this off.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And how is that going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Felix answered. &nbsp;She could tell how impressed he was. &nbsp;Exhausted, working for days underfed and underslept, his body was animated by little more than excitement at this point. &nbsp;&ldquo;They can create such small magnetic bottles for the stuff that we can almost make hand held weapons with them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not exactly practical,&rdquo; Kathryn frowned.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Say that when we&rsquo;re boarded,&rdquo; Felix countered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your conventional weapons will be effective against enemy Bobbins themselves if you are boarded,&rdquo; Bob assured her. &nbsp;&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll need to target the mirror balls first if they are accompanying enemy soldiers. &nbsp;Both sides have been working on animating shadow matter as combat drones but neither side have had much luck with that to date. &nbsp;We are currently studying your mechanoids to see if their study can advance our research but making combat ready models before the final confrontation remains unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took a moment for Kathryn to realize it was talking about Margaret and Ralph, but she nodded her understanding when it did come to her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The real problem is delivery,&rdquo; Felix continued. &nbsp;Simulations are clear that our native anti-matter tipped missiles would be destroyed ninety-nine times out of a hundred when shot at their ships, so the Bobbins have been rushing to modify their own projectiles to house anti-matter and calculating the most practical yield to be effective while stretching it as far as we can. &nbsp;We need a good chance at being able to disable their ships with one shot and no more. &nbsp;Vaporizing them entirely would be a waste of-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The entire room suddenly shook violently and kicked over to emergency lighting as alarms started blaring. &nbsp;Before thought could motivate her, Kathryn was past them and flying through the doorway to the bridge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Report!&rdquo; &nbsp;When her thoughts had had a chance to chime in, the concern was that the battle had already come to them while they were still completely unprepared.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;On the viewscreen she saw a section of the Orbital One habitat ring just gone. &nbsp;At the edges of where it used to be, a lattice of mangled structural material apologized for now being unused and the remnants of an expanding debris cloud could be seen radiating out from the centre of what used to be there in a sphere.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Understanding what had happened before being told, she held up her hand to Jaren as he opened his mouth to explain, and pressed the general broadcast button on the captain&rsquo;s chair side panel. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All ships with working Bobbin shields raise them now!&rdquo; &nbsp;She pointed at Lieutenant Tarsus at the ops station as she said it, and he dutifully projected a shell of shadow matter around the New Horizon II. &nbsp;She could see it close a curtain of darkness in front of them on the view screen before it switched to a wavelength which could see through it, if with limited colour contrast. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn held her breath for less than a couple seconds waiting for impacts but when they came they were less than she feared. &nbsp;She pressed the button on the panel which silenced the alarms and they all listened to the sound of stray pieces of the station striking the shell of shielding. &nbsp;Another explosion rocked through the tight fleet and the viewscreen automatically rotated to see one of the smaller frigates explode. &nbsp;It was much nearer to the original blast and whether through damage from the initial explosion or not being able to raise their shields in time, their fusion reactor had obviously lost containment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Nobody made a sound on the bridge as they then listened to the second wave of ejecta striking the shell of material around the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;New lights and noises started up from Tarsus&rsquo; operations control panel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Reports coming in Admiral,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;That was the <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Lorenzo Snow</em>. &nbsp;The <em>Miltiades</em> and the <em>Wandering Dream</em> are critically damaged, but&hellip; looks like they have the situation under control and emergency teams are responding.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That part of the habitat ring was where they were working on new anti-matter delivery systems, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she turned to ask Felix and Bob. &nbsp;Felix was pale and seemed in shock, but Bob&rsquo;s eye stalks nodded that she was correct.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are fortunate to have only allowed a few micrograms of material into the lab.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s eyes blazed at it, and its mirror ball flashed indignance. &nbsp;She had enough sense to restrain herself, and to hold her arm out to block Jaren from rushing towards him. &nbsp;Instead of forcing his way though he stopped and Kathryn was glad she wasn&rsquo;t going to relieve him of duty already.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren,&rdquo; she said, turning to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please go and take lead on rescue and recovery.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Tearing his eyes away from Bob, when he turned to her and saw his own outraged matched in Kathryn&rsquo;s, he breathed in deeply through his nose and slowly exhaled with his eyes closed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; He stated stiffly before walking past Bob and out the bridge, already on his scroll coordinating efforts.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We evacuated the rest of that section,&rdquo; the ghost of Felix muttered, &ldquo;but fuck&hellip;&rdquo; he exasperated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Some of my best and brightest people were working in that lab.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Mine too,&rdquo; Bob said. &nbsp;His mirror ball displaying genuine anguish for the first time she&rsquo;d seen.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn put her right hand to her forehead and rubbed her temples with her thumb and middle finger for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s changed.&rdquo; she reminded herself. &nbsp;She knew that everything that needed to be done to respond to the crisis would happen automatically now without her input. &nbsp;&ldquo;Lieutenant Tarsus.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back to the ready room. &nbsp;Forward to me all reports to me there and call me if I&rsquo;m needed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn held out her arm in the direction of her office to Bob and Felix. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Behind her desk Kathryn had her scroll opened as large as it went and docked it into the desk and glanced at it as new information came in. &nbsp;It was nothing unexpected, clarification on damage to other ships, names of the missing, the confirmed dead. &nbsp;Some names she knew, most she didn&rsquo;t, a couple she knew personally.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How badly does this set us back?&rdquo; she asked Bob.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fortunately, our work was nearly complete. &nbsp;The data gathered was backed up and we have enough to begin testing designs. &nbsp;I can only express my deepest regrets and sympathies Admiral. &nbsp;I had colleagues I was close to who were working there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t spoken and the colour hadn&rsquo;t returned to his cheeks &nbsp;&ldquo;<em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Felix?</em>&rdquo; she harshly demanded. &nbsp;He snapped out of it and looked at her but still seemed in a daze. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix how much have you slept in the last few days?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob&rsquo;s eye stalks looked up at him and then back at Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; it stated matter of factly. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix I&rsquo;m ordering you to bed for at least 8 hours. &nbsp;Stop by the medical bay and have the doctor give you something to ensure you sleep.&rdquo; &nbsp;The man seemed to want to protest, but instead slumped in place with acceptance. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go to Taj, let him take care of you. &nbsp;Do what you need to to recharge. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to need you fresh for what comes next. &nbsp;Bob&rsquo;s people can finish the upgrades and new weapons.&rdquo; &nbsp;Felix nodded and exited through the door.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After he&rsquo;d left Kathryn bit her thumb as another name she knew well showed up on the scrolling incident report.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The weapons, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you had had much more sleep than your friend,&rdquo; Bob said. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be sure to get some rest before the op, but right now tell me about the weapons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh somehow translating through its mirror ball. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have essentially designed small ships with powerful thrust and maneuvering engines which house an antimatter core. &nbsp;They should be able to outmaneuver the enemy defenses and strike with a success rate of over 80 percent. &nbsp;Even if shot down before striking directly, on losing magnetic containment the anti-matter material will still detonate and shower the target ship with a radiating cone of destruction. &nbsp;If we had months more we could design something more reliable, but this is the best we can do on such a tight timeline.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What intelligence reports are you getting from your people on the enemy?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;She was waiting for an estimate on the scrolling information as to how long it would take to repair Orbital One, but what came instead was skepticism that the station could ever be repaired to safe working order at all with the amount of structural damage sustained. &nbsp;Looked like the <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Mitiades</em> was beyond repair in time for the attack as well. &nbsp;&lsquo;Damn,&rsquo; she cursed in thought. &nbsp;&lsquo;We already didn&rsquo;t have enough ships. &nbsp;Damn&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have obtained a thorough assessment of the strength of the central plexus&rsquo; defenses. &nbsp;They appear to be fortifying their positions, which could indicate they are expecting some sort of attack which is bad for us. &nbsp;They have some sixty ships guarding the facility, at least half of their total fleet. &nbsp;Five icosahedrons, over a dozen dodecahedron, and the rest octahedrons, cubes, and tetrahedrons. &nbsp;Our side has only two icosahedrons and four dodecahedrons, only a handful of smaller vessels, plus yours. &nbsp;Even with the anti-matter weapons victory is a challenging proposition.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But not impossible.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Not impossible.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How are your people responding to this plan?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Mixed I&rsquo;m afraid. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to apologize that we are not committing more forces to this battle. &nbsp;If it were up to me we&rsquo;d be committing every gram of shadow matter we have to this assault, but a third of our combined fleet is guarding the home world and another third guarding out intergalactic rift crystal. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s&hellip; insane.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It absolutely is,&rdquo; Kathryn agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;But if we hadn&rsquo;t been attacked directly I&rsquo;m afraid you might not have even gotten that much from us for the effort.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But I assure you Admiral, if we pull this off it will be some time before you find the depth of my people&rsquo;s gratitude for your efforts and sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll hold you to that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what is this battle going to look like? &nbsp;Are we going to have to destroy every last enemy position? &nbsp;What happens to them after we take down the central plexus?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we really can&rsquo;t say. &nbsp;Those within the system will be disconnected but there&rsquo;s no way to know how they&rsquo;ll react, whether they&rsquo;ll continue fighting afterwards or not. &nbsp;Either way, whatever changes there are will propagate to any system we then open a rift to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What if we reprogrammed it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Bob asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you mean what I think you do, it goes against everything my people are fighting and dying for.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand but consider the stakes. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m not talking about a permanent influence. &nbsp;What if before destroying the link altogether we propagated out a message, something that would stick with them after the link was gone. &nbsp;An urging to surrender, to see the harm of relying on the link like that. &nbsp;Just something to make them less scared and angry when they wake up from their nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about that myself,&rdquo; Bob admitted, &ldquo;but I will relay the suggestion to my superiors. &nbsp;Given the situation they may be willing to bend the rules in this way, provided as you say it is merely a temporary suggestion left with them once the link is taken down.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Kathryn said as she looked out the window as the hulk of Orbital One and the damage done to it came into view. &nbsp;&ldquo;Because we have to win this one Bob&hellip; we <em style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>have</em> to.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;To that end, I should bring up some unusual requests your simulant has made&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
