            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sat in her captain&rsquo;s seat in the centre of the bridge reviewing the more extensive damage report Felix had prepared. &nbsp;It was a little worse than she&rsquo;d originally thought, they really were lucky to still be flying. &nbsp;The systems still working were working fairly well, engines, radiation shields, but things that were compromised were almost beyond repair. &nbsp;The electrical system was nearly completely shot, and based on the degree of hull damage she wasn&rsquo;t sure if they&rsquo;d be able to repair it or scavenge this beautiful new ship for parts when making a new one.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; The pilot aksed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Aisha?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The portal is operating properly, but&hellip; we&rsquo;re not receiving the go ahead signal.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After opening a portal it was standard procedure for the other side to broadcast a simple transmission indicating that it was safe to travel through. &nbsp;The absence of any signal was odd though, if there was a problem they should be signalling details on the problem instead.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing? &nbsp; No signals whatsoever?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn thought about it for a moment before ordering: &ldquo;Slow our descent Aisha, hold position in orbit above the portal. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re not fling in blind.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; &nbsp; The pilot started tapping at the panel in front of her, but apparently met with some frustration. &nbsp;She reached over and started tapping at the operations stations&rsquo; panel to the slight confusion of the officer sitting at that station.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am? &nbsp; The&hellip; the controls aren&rsquo;t responding, I can&rsquo;t adjust our course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The&hellip; controls aren&rsquo;t dead, we&rsquo;re still making small and proper course corrections on our original heading, but&hellip; I can&rsquo;t input a new course. &nbsp;It looks like some sort of program has taken control and I can&rsquo;t override.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn opened a channel to Felix and Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have a problem. &nbsp;An unknown program has taken over navigation. &nbsp;We aren&rsquo;t receiving the go ahead signal from Earth so I ordered a halt on our approach but the controls are dead. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re heading in anyways.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No signal at all?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing. &nbsp; Felix, see what you can do about the controls. &nbsp;It may just be battle damage, our course locked in somehow and new inputs not reaching navigation. &nbsp;Jaren I want you to look to see if there is some sort of malicious program at work here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Both men acknowledged their instructions and closed the channel to get to work.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it, but it concerned her. &nbsp;Ultimately, though it was the correct move to hold in the absence of a signal from Earth, there was nonetheless a part of her that wanted to proceed regardless to investigate why there was no signal coming through. &nbsp; Regardless, she didn&rsquo;t like not having control of her own ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not autopilot,&rdquo; Felix reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Something</em> is guiding us in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; &nbsp; She switched over to hail Jaren. &nbsp; &ldquo;Felix says someone or something is actively guiding us in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I agree, but I can&rsquo;t isolate the source. &nbsp;How this is being done is beyond me.&rdquo; &nbsp;He seemed concerned, but not panicked. Coolness under pressure was essential in their careers and something they respected about each other. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked over at the one still working wall screen at the surface of the sun which filled the entire screen. &nbsp;They were now close enough and the filters darkened enough that she could see the roiling surface of the sun and the granulation of the seemingly infinite and intermingling convection of the surface. &nbsp;As much as she wanted to go through and see what the problem was on the other side, she even more disliked not being in control of her own ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo; she told him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Work with Felix and bring in anyone else you need to get me control back of my ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Roger that,&rdquo; he answered before closing the channel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn rapped her fingers against the arm rest, then again, and again, thinking hard. &nbsp; She then got up out of her chair. &nbsp; &ldquo;Tarsus,&rdquo; she said to the operations officer, &ldquo;you have the bridge for all the good it will do you. &nbsp;I need to check on something. &nbsp;If you can regain control take us up to a holding orbit, if not I&rsquo;ll be back before we enter the rift.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She stepped over to the lift and after she&rsquo;d stepped inside the doors closed behind her. &nbsp; She ordered it down to the engineering deck and stepped out once it arrived. &nbsp;She stood in front of the quarantined lab they had left Ralph in, and presumably where Felix was still working. &nbsp;She opened the door and stepped in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kat!&rdquo; Felix called with surprise. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;carry on with your efforts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man seemed confused, but he obeyed and turned back to his terminal, resuming his work. &nbsp; The robot body Ralph had been granted stood before his data core like an inanimate automaton. &nbsp;It stood rigid like a statue betraying not a shred of the life it had so convincingly portrayed earlier. &nbsp;She walked up and stood with her face inches from the screen where the robot&rsquo;s face would be displayed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You in there Ralph?&rdquo; she asked softly. &nbsp;There was no response. &nbsp;&ldquo;How long has he been like this?&rdquo; she asked Felix.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now that I think about it,&rdquo; he answered without looking away from his terminal, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard a peep from him in some time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had a suspicion, a suspicion she had no evidence for, nor motivation, but this blank automaton&hellip; she had a feeling it was working on something else instead of interacting with them. &nbsp;She shook her head, a computer that advanced surely must be able to converse with them and manipulate the ship at the same time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix had assured her that it was adequately quarantined, but&hellip; it was such an advanced technology, how could they ever know? &nbsp;If she was right, there was no way to know so what could they do? &nbsp;Smash the computer core in fear and suspicion? &nbsp; What if they were wrong? &nbsp;And besides, how could this machine, even if it was behind locking out their navigation, how could it possibly have had any effect on the signals from Earth?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any luck Felix?&rdquo; she asked while keeping her eyes fixed on the blank face screen of the robot.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he answered in dismay.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, well keep at it. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll soon be at the rift so I&rsquo;ve got to get to the bridge. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know what situation we&rsquo;re going to be flying into on the other side, so I&rsquo;m also going to need you to do what you can to get us ready for whatever we may find on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; he said without looking away from his console. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn made her way back up to the bridge with increasing unease as she felt them approaching the rift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright everyone,&rdquo; she called out over a general broadcast to the whole ship, &ldquo;be ready for anything.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They entered the rift and felt the familiar though perpetually disorienting sensation of breaking through normal space into something unknown to the human body, and fall back so abruptly into a space-time the body was comfortable with. &nbsp; As soon as she could regain her composure she called out commands to give her a full situational assessment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She was frustrated by the length of time it seemed to take for anyone to respond to her. &nbsp; Jaren answered her first.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We, are&hellip; not in the Terran system,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What? &nbsp; Oh. &nbsp;Well that would explain why we weren&rsquo;t hearing their signals.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, but we&rsquo;re still not getting any signals of any of our systems.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right&hellip; so where are we?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hard to say with most of our instruments blown off&hellip; I was counting on the navigation beacons to bring us back in, but we&rsquo;re not getting anything, not a damn thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She noted his frustration and moved on. &nbsp;&ldquo;What instruments <em>can</em> we make use of?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Our primary navigation scopes are only of use at close range. &nbsp;We were able to navigate in the previous system because we&rsquo;d already mapped it out and we could fly by models of the system we had already created with our mapping. &nbsp;If we knew what system this was we could do the same thing, but we don&rsquo;t even know that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And there are no welcome ships nearby? &nbsp;No standard portal security fleet?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren checked his panel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Pilot, do you have control again?&rdquo; she asked Aisha.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Negative Captain. &nbsp;Whatever was directing us before is still in control of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Damn.&rdquo; she stated in frustration.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; Felix&rsquo;s face asked after it appeared on the one working wall screen.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is is?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s Ralph. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s&hellip; you&rsquo;re going to want to come down here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&lsquo;I knew it.&rsquo; she ruefully said to herself as her eyes narrowed.</p>
