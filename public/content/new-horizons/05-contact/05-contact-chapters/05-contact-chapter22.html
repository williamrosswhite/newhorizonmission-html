            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Back on the ship, Kathryn had called a general meeting in the dining hall and most were able to convene before her. &nbsp;The only ones who could not were those who could not leave their post, and they were listening in over the comm system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;An arrangement has been made with the aliens, you are all going home.&rdquo; &nbsp;There were muted cheers through the crowd. &nbsp;&ldquo;I however will not be going with you. &nbsp; Jaren and I have to stay and do what we can to find and save our daughter Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Concerned murmuring ran through the crowd and Kathryn held her hand up to quiet them. &nbsp; &ldquo;I know that many of you would volunteer to stay and help us, and as much as I appreciate that more than you know, I cannot allow it. &nbsp;You all demonstrated tremendous bravery and loyalty coming to this system with us and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. &nbsp;I have the opportunity to get you all home now, and I am duty bound to take it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is time to go home, and you are bringing with you the secrets of the galaxy to our people back home. &nbsp;The universe has shifted under our seat with the revelations of the past month, and the people back home have to be informed. &nbsp;<em>That</em> is your mission now. &nbsp;We are making final preparations, and the ship will depart in forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was a mixed reaction from the crowd as she stepped down, a tension between relief at going home and agitation at feeling like they were leaving a job half done. &nbsp; Some felt entirely one way or the other, some internalized this tension within themselves and their own competing feelings.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn addressed him heavily.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he uttered with dread at seeing her expression, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t ask me to-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She stopped him with a raise of her hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to stay. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got a husband, a life&hellip; &nbsp;I know if I gave you the choice like many of the crew you&rsquo;d stay, but I can&rsquo;t let you. &nbsp; I need you to take command of New Horizon II and take it home. &nbsp;I need you to tell our story and relay to command everything that&rsquo;s happened, everything that&rsquo;s at stake now. &nbsp;Ask them nicely if they could spare a couple warships with as many antimatter warheads as they can stuff on them. &nbsp;Yes it&rsquo;s probably wiser for them to take up a defensive posture with them until you hear from us again, but&hellip; still.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix sighed heavily. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well on a Bobbin ship you wouldn&rsquo;t have much use for human engineer anyways&hellip; &nbsp;Maggie though&hellip; you know I&rsquo;d stay and help if you gave me the choice right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She put her hand on his shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man nodded solemnly and turned to leave her be and start getting the ship ready to leave. &nbsp; He stopped short and turned to ask: &ldquo;What about Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We need him to fly the ship, so is he coming with us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The computer core is, but the robot is not?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I asked Bill for a favour and he granted it. &nbsp;He separated the A.I. from the core and permanently installed the personality in your robot.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Felix asked the robot who was standing behind Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed it is Felix,&rdquo; it answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I feel at once both liberated and oddly vulnerable and limited. &nbsp;Thank you for the body.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, er, well, take care of it for me then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn playfully punched him on the arm and reminded him, &ldquo;Hey, you can always build another, an even better one next time!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hey yeah,&rdquo; he brightened. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right! &nbsp;Okay everyone,&rdquo; he turned around again to address the crew who were still mulling about, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get to work! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got a lot to do and only two days to do it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well I already know Ralph is with us,&rdquo; Kathryn noted as she turned around, &ldquo;Molly I didn&rsquo;t want to speak for you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you to the end Kat,&rdquo; the simulation of an old woman offered in a rare moment of complete seriousness. &nbsp;Her mood then lightened somewhat. &nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip; do we have any kind of plan or anything?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Some kind of plan,&rdquo; she offered with a positive note while looking over at Jaren. &nbsp; &ldquo;A chance at least, that&rsquo;s all it seems we can ever hope for. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re drawing up a specific operational plan down on the surface right now, in fact we should get down there for the official briefing pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A couple hours later, Kathryn, Jaren, Margaret and Ralph found themselves in a room they had not seen the last time they were in the capital building. &nbsp;It was a rather large building soaked in green light with the walls, floor and ceiling all bare emerald crystal like the exterior of the building. &nbsp;There were several rows of elevated seats at one end of the room, and Kathryn assumed it had something to do with hierarchy and more important aliens sitting in the more elevated positions. &nbsp;She recognized she could be wrong though, inappropriately applying a human cultural convention where it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The most of these aliens they had ever seen at one time before were the three which had boarded their ship. &nbsp;Now they were surrounded by over a hundred all scurrying about seemingly very excitedly. &nbsp; They were all communicating amongst themselves in their ominous infrasound voice and language which just barely registered for Kathryn. &nbsp;The profusion of the sound was beginning to make her nauseous though, and she imagined it must be getting to her ears in an uncomfortable way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can you make out what they&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo; Jaren asked Margaret.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I can hear everything they&rsquo;re saying, but I can&rsquo;t understand one word of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They are debating the merits of the operation as well as the finer details of its planning,&rdquo; Ralph informed them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn felt a deep penetrating rumbling in her feet through the floor, and all of the aliens began scurrying to sit up on benches arranged in rows before the elevated seats at one end of the room. &nbsp;She realized that a heavy bass note for them must be the equivalent of an attention getting bell or chime for humans. &nbsp;She gestured for her teammates to likewise sit down on the benches where they could find spare room.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Though she understood she needn&rsquo;t be, she felt somewhat embarrassed that she couldn&rsquo;t for the life of her determine which of the aliens was Bill, or if he was even in the room with them at all. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t spent enough time with them to learn the differences in their appearance which would denote one from the other, if there were any.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;One of the mirror balls approached and hung in midair before her and her team and when an alien rose to speak officially it translated for them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It has been agreed by the Surpreme War Council that %&amp;W#&amp;% and a small force, accompanied by the humans, will use the captures shuttle to infiltrate the tertiary node in the @#$%^&amp;**&amp;E system. &nbsp;They will conduct a stealth approach and then engage in a hot retreat using the anti-matter weapons provided by the humans. &nbsp;This information can turn the war, the more so the quicker we work to exploit the information. &nbsp;The human ship will depart in thirty-nine %&amp;Y%*U, and this mission will commence as soon as possible following their departure.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;And that was that. &nbsp;The ball disappeared, and the meeting seemed to disband somewhat abruptly as far as Kathryn was concerned. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was just their convention, or if they were just far more actively engaged in other things than she&rsquo;d imagined. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s that then,&rdquo; Margaret offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;One of the aliens approached them with a mirror ball floating behind it. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled then,&rdquo; it said through the device.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bill?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, okay. &nbsp; Yes, it seems like we&rsquo;re going then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We depart in forty hours, would you like to see more of this world and sleep here, or would you prefer to go directly to your new ship, familiarize yourself with it, and sleep there?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The ship,&rdquo; Kathryn answered without checking with the rest. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a feeling we&rsquo;re going to need all the time we have. &nbsp; Plus, I want to personally oversee the handing over of the weapons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well, follow me.&rdquo; &nbsp;It began walking away and the team followed it. &nbsp;&ldquo;We would like to make an additional request.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your vessels&rsquo; propulsion systems are also anti-matter based.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We wish to harvest that material as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well they&rsquo;re going to need it to get back to base.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are prepared to equip your ship with one of our inertia engines.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is that one of the ones that makes your ships accelerate at impossible rates?&rdquo; Jaren piped up to ask.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not impossible of course,&rdquo; Bill answered as he led them out of the room, &ldquo;but yes, a drive similar to the ones you have seen in operation.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask about that,&rdquo; Jaren continued, &ldquo;how do you do that without liquefying those inside the ship on the rear bulkhead.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They do not operate on direct force. &nbsp;They operate by generating gravity and thus do not generate any acceleration forces.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I have no idea what that means.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Regardless, our offer?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You want to harvest all of the anti-matter from the ship-&ldquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The shuttles as well,&rdquo; Bill interrupted</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;From the ship and shuttles, and in exchange you&rsquo;ll outfit New Horizon II with one of your magical propulsion drives which our engineers can study.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What will you use that material for?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our mission,&rdquo; it answered. &nbsp;It led them to a platform like the one which had taken them to the roof the day before, and it began lowering them to the ground floor with each floor they passed materializing again above their heads. &nbsp;Kathryn still hadn&rsquo;t gotten used to that.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your weapons are devastating on impact, but your propulsion, targeting, and navigation make them limiting. &nbsp;We are going to extract the anti-matter pods from them and pair them to a more effective gravity drive missile. &nbsp;We wish to do the same with all of the storage pods on your ships as well. &nbsp;The more weaponry we have, the better our chances of escape from the alien system.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That makes sense&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn looked at Jaren. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d been together long enough that she was pretty efficient at judging his expressions. &nbsp;He seemed to be silently saying to her &lsquo;in for a penny, in for a pound&hellip;&rsquo; with a touch of &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a good deal if there&rsquo;s no catch or unexpected complications&rsquo;.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well, we agree. &nbsp;If you will install the new engine and control interface for us, I will have my people prepare the fuel pods for you to pick up. &nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than six hours for them to safely extract all of them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Excellent. &nbsp; I will have our engineers begin work on your vessel immediately.&rdquo;</p>
