            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;WHAT DO YOU <em>MEAN</em> they &lsquo;<em>took Maggie</em>&rsquo;!? &nbsp;How could you let that happen!?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>HEY</em>!! &nbsp;Six good people <em>died</em> trying to <em>stop</em> it from happening!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Gradually, Kathryn&rsquo;s military training kicked in. &nbsp;Focus. &nbsp;Learn the situation. &nbsp;Respond appropriately. &nbsp;Effect what you can, deal with what you can&rsquo;t later. &nbsp;If she focused on her daughter in danger right now she&rsquo;d be useless at confronting the rest of the challenges onslaughting her right now and that wouldn&rsquo;t be any good for anyone, let alone Maggie.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tell me exactly what happened.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;After we lost contact, the three ships slammed into the hull hard and penetrated. &nbsp;After they left the entire section vented but emergency bulkheads are sealing them off now. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got a few people trapped in rooms on the other side of vacuum that we&rsquo;re working on reaching now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix leaned back against the wall behind him and slid down until he was sitting on the floor. &nbsp;He took a deep but shaky breath as he wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think their primary target was the computer core,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;They penetrated as near to it as you possibly could. &nbsp; I think Maggie was just the closest human to their entry point, that anyone nearest would have been taken.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>But why</em>!??&rdquo; Jaren demanded. &nbsp;His eyes were glowing with barely contained rage and when Kathryn looked at him she remembered that he must be feeling exactly as helpless, angry, and confused as herself, though a deep part of herself forbid accepting that it was possible for anyone in human history to feel those things as burning bright as she was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How the hell would I know?&rdquo; Felix snapped back, with growing anger in his defensiveness. &nbsp; &ldquo;I can only tell you what happened.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then go on,&rdquo; Kathryn said in her solid military voice which masked the shaking which would have otherwise be there.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I saw them. &nbsp; They blew Binh&rsquo;s head apart right beside me. &nbsp;They looked just like Ralph described his builders of looking, four legs, torso in the middle with two arms&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; Ralph&rsquo;s robot protested, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no conceivable way that my builder&rsquo;s could-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Before he could finish his sentence, Kathryn had pulled her side arm out of it&rsquo;s holster, brought it up to the robot, looked down the sight at the it&rsquo;s dumb projected face, and blew the head apart in a spray of plastic and metal shrapnel down the corridor behind it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was incredibly stupid but was an incredibly cathartic release. &nbsp;She could have damaged the ship, probably did in fact. &nbsp; They may have needed Ralph now more than ever for information if not for more direct assistance, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d done it before she&rsquo;d even thought about it, but thinking about it in the moments after she had no regrets. &nbsp; It felt right.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>What the fuck Kat??</em>&rdquo; Felix desperately exclaimed in shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;My robot!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he crawled over to the lifeless electronic corpse. &nbsp; Margaret grew a half smile on her face which mirrored Kat&rsquo;s and gave a slight chuckle as she pulled out another cigar and savoured lighting it as the smoke was automatically sucked into an air vent. &nbsp;Jaren just looked at her with what bordered on disbelief which had a touch of disappointed all too believability to it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix. &nbsp; Continue your report,&rdquo; Jaren ordered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix was visibly angry and was looking back and forth between Kathryn and the still robot. &nbsp; He answered though. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They moved fast. &nbsp;Two held their distance while the one penetrated. &nbsp;They headed straight for the computer core melting a passageway through every bulkhead they encountered along the way, I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. &nbsp;Whatever tool it was they used the same technique to cut the core out of the wall and sever all of the connections. &nbsp;Whether on their way there or back, Maggie and my suite was directly adjacent to their path, just on the other side of a bulkhead along the way. &nbsp;They cut through and, and&hellip; they took her.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man shrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;Either that or&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; Kathryn demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Or she was blown out to space when they disengaged and turned every section they&rsquo;d cut into to vacuum. &nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t think that happened! &nbsp;There&rsquo;d be no reason to cut into the suite just to do that to her, they <em>must</em> have taken her.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright&hellip; alright,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix and Margaret, assess the damage. &nbsp;In ten minutes I want an assessment of what we can and can&rsquo;t still do with our core missing and the wound in the side of the ship. &nbsp;After that get me an assessment of what can be fixed and how long each thing would take if prioritized. &nbsp;Understood?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix nodded as he stood up from cradling the robot body on the ground. &nbsp;Margaret pushed off of the wall and put her cigar out on the wall as she nodded herselt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Margaret said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Come on everyone,&rdquo; Felix said to the rest of the personnel. &nbsp;He had a note of resignation in an otherwise resolved tone of voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do.&rdquo; &nbsp;He led the rest of them out of the section off to their duties, Margaret included.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;This left Kathryn and Jaren finally alone. &nbsp;Kathryn fell into Jaren&rsquo;s arm and started crying as she put her head on her shoulder. &nbsp; It was rare for her to so nakedly express herself, but they were alone, and if she could collapse with anyone it was him. &nbsp;Jaren wasn&rsquo;t holding himself together much better.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They didn&rsquo;t say anything, for there was nothing to say. &nbsp;They both felt the same, both understood the dame, both wishing to reassure the other as they were seeking to be reassured.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get her back,&rdquo; Jaren whispered in her ear. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a statement of fact or even a promise, but more a statement of intent. &nbsp; It was a promise that they would try, that nothing else mattered now but doing everything they could to find her and get her back. &nbsp;Neither had any idea how this was possible, or even that she was right now still alive. &nbsp; They would try though, they would exhaust every opportunity before giving up, and even then try something else.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded as she pulled away and wiped the tears away from her bleary eyes. &nbsp;She looked at Jaren in time to see him doing the same. &nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bridge?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;re dealing with here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Once they&rsquo;d resumed their posts on the bridge, Felix messaged up his report. &nbsp;They could still manually fire the engines and operate most systems, but navigation calculations would have to be done by hand which was not only error prone, but incredibly lengthy and time consuming. &nbsp;This however, was not much of an issue since they had no maps of the system and no telescopes to generate any, and couldn&rsquo;t calculate a trajectory anywhere regardless.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He pointed out that with some difficulty and given enough time there was a good chance that they could make their way back down the gravity well to the star and make it down to a rift portal, but they of course had no way of accessing and opening the alien rift system. &nbsp;And without a computer core, trying to hack in was now especially impossible. &nbsp;As for the hull, he said that he&rsquo;d already dispatched a crew to plate over and seal up the hole the penetrating craft had made. &nbsp; They were prepping at the nearest airlock and were about to head out.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Life support and power systems being critical were all equipped with manual redundant systems which had automatically kicked in. &nbsp;They would have to be babysat and manually adjusted from time to time, but Felix had already assigned a couple crew to plant themselves in front of the manual controls and do just that. &nbsp;Engineering or the bridge could contact them to make deliberate adjustments at any time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;With some hesitation, Felix pointed out that they had two shuttles, and there was plenty of territory down on the planet that in a worst case scenario could be colonized and they could make a good go of it. &nbsp;No one was anywhere near considering that possibility yet of course, but he felt duty bound to point it out and Kathryn understood.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not that I imagine anyone cares,&rdquo; he finally added, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be able to repair P4.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn took a moment to notice that he had called it P4 again instead of Ralph. &nbsp; Maybe in his mind she had shot Ralph out of P4&rsquo;s head. &nbsp;Maybe he thought that referring to it as P4 wouldn&rsquo;t anger her that he&rsquo;d even bothered to check.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got enough spare parts lying around to reassemble the head. &nbsp;I <em>think</em> anyways.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you Felix. &nbsp;Once you have all essential work locked down feel free to work on your robot,&rdquo; she reassured him. &nbsp;&ldquo;We may not be going anywhere for a bit after all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren swivelled around in the chair he was strapped down to in the zero gravity by pushing his feet against the ground, anchored in the opposite direction by his harness. &nbsp;&ldquo;About that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man seemed reluctant, but it had to be said. &nbsp;&ldquo;There <em>is</em> still a starship&rsquo;s computer core onboard.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked at him with an even stare that betrayed nothing, but when she began chewing the inside of her cheek he knew her well enough to recognize what that meant. &nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t like what he&rsquo;d said or what it implied, but she knew he was right. &nbsp;She pressed a button on her arm control panel and rubbed her right eye with the back of her index finger as she said: &ldquo;Felix?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The alien A.I.,&rdquo; it no longer seemed amusing to refer to it as Ralph, &ldquo;I presume it&rsquo;s still online?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s not doing much. &nbsp;Without a computer core to tap into there&rsquo;s not much it can do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; Could you patch a signal form it into the bridge comm system so I could&hellip; have a word with it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I, er- yeah, of course. &nbsp;Give me just a second.&rdquo; &nbsp;A few moments passed before he reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, patched through. &nbsp;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The problem was now she didn&rsquo;t know what else to address it as. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am here</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn rapped her fingers slowly on her arm rest. &nbsp;It seemed a little awkward speaking to something she&rsquo;d just blown its face through the back of its head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How are things?&rdquo; she asked, somewhat amused with herself. &nbsp;Felix shot her a bewildered look.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am once again trapped in my core. &nbsp;I knew nothing else for so long, and yet now I feel so&hellip; immobile.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re aware of the condition of New Horizon II?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Based on the damage I head described before you destroyed my avatar I can infer the condition</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She didn&rsquo;t detect any indication that it had taken being shot in the face particularly personally.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix tells me that one upside of the ship&rsquo;s core being gone is that you&rsquo;re no longer to control it and the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was a pause. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>That is correct</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few more raps on the arm rest.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix and others report that beings just as you described boarded this ship and stole not only our computer core but&hellip; my daughter as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>As I said, that is impossible</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a computer Ralph. &nbsp;Is it impossible, or merely improbable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The A.I. didn&rsquo;t answer at first, giving Kathryn a chance to raise an eyebrow at Jaren to suggest that maybe she&rsquo;d gotten it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Improbable</em>.&rdquo; it reluctantly admitted.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay, now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. &nbsp;So tell me. &nbsp; Given how improbable you find it, tell me what could result in such an improbable occurrence coming to pass.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Another long pause.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>War</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Between&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Internal warfare</em>,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>That could also explain what happened to Infinity Base</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&lsquo;Of course,&rdquo; Kathryn thought to herself. &lsquo;Of course&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why would that lead internal warfare between your builders to board our ship and steal our core and my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Research</em>,&rdquo; it answered plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Oh how she didn&rsquo;t like the sound of that. &nbsp;&ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>It is standard protocol&hellip; it was standard protocol to attempt contact with any new space faring species the builders encountered to learn about them. &nbsp;This general imperative is part of why it was necessary to bring you here, to meet them. &nbsp; However, this kind of aggressive research was never directed. &nbsp;One or more sides in the conflict may have taken this general principle to an extreme, to study by force in wartime any new space faring species</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One or more&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph I&rsquo;m in a tough spot.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Explain</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Without your help we&rsquo;ve got one option. &nbsp;Set down on the surface of this planet and try to make the best of it. &nbsp;Hope we&rsquo;ve got the equipment and wherewithal to set up a colony and not be wiped out by god know&rsquo;s what, including at any moment being noticed and wiped out in your builder&rsquo;s war.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your chances would be low,&rdquo; the A.I. observed matter of factly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She made eye contact with Jaren and shook her head in contempt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any other possibly actions would involve connecting you directly to the ship&rsquo;s network and have you serve as the ship&rsquo;s computer core instead of merely controlling it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It didn&rsquo;t say anything. &nbsp;She wondered if it was thinking or waiting for her to say something else. &nbsp;Then she remembered it could think a million times faster than she could.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My daughter was taken,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but my professional priority must be the safe return home of the crew I have left, and hope that command lets us mount another better prepared expedition to come find her.&rdquo; &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t bother to ask it if she thought the aggressors would keep her daughter alive for questioning or just dissect her. &nbsp;What could she tell them that wasn&rsquo;t in the computer core? &nbsp;She pushed the dark thought out of her head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that moment she looked up at the wall screen in response to an unexpected dimming of the bright blue star. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t as much dimming as she&rsquo;d come to expect from a rift transit, but still just enough to be clearly noticeable.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Jaren answered her unspoken question. &nbsp;Something just either came through or left through the rift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Probably the mother ship of the smaller craft which attacked your ship</em>,&rdquo; the A.I. suggested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That was fast,&rdquo; Kathryn observed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Too fast,&rdquo; Jaren agreed with a nod.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come out with it then,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Will you help us return to our native rift system?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>No</em>,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn crinkled up half of her face. &nbsp;She was after all only half disappointed to hear his answer. &nbsp;Her professional half was displeased. &nbsp;However the answer allowed her maternal half to maintain a sliver of hope.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If we integrated you into the ship, what <em>would</em> you be willing to?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>My priority is still to make every effort to report to the capital planet</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not knowing what side of the conflict holds the capital, nor if there is any side at all which might be any friendlier to us than those who have already attacked us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Correct</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see. &nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be in touch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn closed the channel and looked over at Jaren. &nbsp;They both knew what the other was thinking. &nbsp;Flying blind into a system potentially no more hospitable than those who had captured their daughter in the first place was certainly a risk, but at the same time it also presented the faint hope that it would be the opposing side who might be resistant to their aggressors and maybe somehow be able to help them get Maggie back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She pushed another button on her arm rest panel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Margaret to the bridge please, Margaret to the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few moments later the simulant arrived looking somewhat dishevelled with a touch of grime on her face and hands and with her hair quite haggardly out of place though still retaining some structural integrity from how she&rsquo;d originally put it up. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d obviously been hard at work with the others.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Kat?&rdquo; she asked as she floated onto the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Could you give us the room please,&rdquo; she said to the pilot and operations officer who didn&rsquo;t have much to do with the ship in the condition it was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain,&rdquo; the ops officer said as he led the pilot into the lift. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to quickly pop down to grab some lunch, can we bring you anything.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was the first time she&rsquo;d thought to notice how hungry she indeed was. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sure. &nbsp;Just bring Jaren and I some of whatever you grab, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The pilot nodded and the two disappeared behind the closing door of the lift.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well Molly,&rdquo; Kathryn said as she undid her harness and stretched her body out. &nbsp;&ldquo;It appears we&rsquo;ve got two options. &nbsp;We can either land everyone on the surface here and make our best go of setting up a colony forever out of touch with home and with any number of ways it could all turn out disastrously fatal, or we can integrate Ralph into the ship and have him complete his mission. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d fly us through the portal to their capital planet where we will either meet the very same hostile force that attacked us, or an unknown faction with no idea how they&rsquo;d respond to us or treat us. &nbsp;Option two however, is the only one that leaves any possibility whatsoever of tracking down Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So when do we leave?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn smiled at her assumption. &nbsp;It seemed no choice at all for her, but she was ancient already, already survived an apocalypse and been reborn in a new invulnerable body. &nbsp;Her perception of risk had obviously skewed over the centuries.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Setting down here is the safe choice, the option with the least risk, risky as it still may be. &nbsp;Going after Maggie, is foolish at best, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s Maggie,&rdquo; Margaret said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; The thing is I want the crew&rsquo;s input. &nbsp; Obviously as the Captain I can&rsquo;t have people openly vote on something like this, but I want to know what they think before I make my decision. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t in good conscience throw all of their lives to the wind to go after my daughter if most of them would strongly prefer to make their best go of it down on the surface here instead.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren and I could never get an honest answer out of them, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you. &nbsp; Move about the ship for me, talk to people. &nbsp;Confide in them what our options are and get a feel for what they think we should do. &nbsp; When you feel like you&rsquo;ve got a sense of the crew&rsquo;s general view, report back to me and I&rsquo;ll make my decision.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The simulated woman seemed a little irritated at their not just going after Maggie with not deliberation, but Kathryn trusted her to the task she&rsquo;d assigned her. &nbsp;She was the type to be honest to a fault; she would seek the crew&rsquo;s general view earnestly and report what she surmised to Kathryn honestly, even if she disagreed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked over at Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, letting out an emotionally exhausted sigh, &ldquo;you know my vote.&rdquo;</p>
