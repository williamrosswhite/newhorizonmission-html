            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few hours later Kathryn returned to her rather spacious suite onboard Orbital One, a suite which was a perk of her office as commander of the station. &nbsp;As a research facility and occasional ceremonial meeting place for the three different governments, much of the large station remained empty. &nbsp;In its prime though, it was a bustling hub of trade, diplomacy, and transport catering a Solar System of nine billion humans, which made living and commercial space on it quite a prized commodity. &nbsp;The commander&rsquo;s suite was the same size as the special suites reserved for visiting heads of states, easily three times that of what her immediate subordinate would have been allotted back in the day.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But for the last fifteen years, it had been their home as they&rsquo;d grown together as a small family. &nbsp;They had a little place down on Earth as well on Haven and Kobol, but those were just places they visited and vacationed. &nbsp;Somehow this statin had become their home in an unexpectedly intimate way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she entered into the main living area, she saw her daughter Maggie doing what she was often found to be doing, drawing on the living room table in front of the wall screen. &nbsp;Sometime she watched scripted shows from the various worlds or ancient ones from the old archives, but today she just had on a simulated Martian vista, programmed to occasionally superimpose wildly improbable animals happening past as though it were a naturalistic observation video.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She was fourteen years old, only just, but with the parents she had and as an only child with few others to associate with on a regular basis, she was remarkably mature for her age. &nbsp;She was still fourteen though, and her hair&rsquo;s style and colour seemed to change every week. &nbsp; Presently it was cut rather short and styled in a deliberately messy way, blond with broad and dramatic purple streaks in it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hey Mom, what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; she casually asked without looking up from her work. &nbsp;Being scientists and engineers and explorers themselves, Kathryn and Jaren had always tacitly hoped that those qualities and interests would rub off on their young one, but that&rsquo;s not how it had turned out. &nbsp; Maggie was a good student certainly and had a fair aptitude for the sciences, but never seemed to have the heart for it so they never pushed her too hard in that direction. &nbsp;Instead they&rsquo;d encouraged her to pursue what did interest her which as it turned out was any number of styles of art.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Art of various kinds were ever more clearly as she aged where her own heart lay, though she hadn&rsquo;t so far fell in love with any particular form and still experimented with many. &nbsp;She loved to draw characters more than landscapes, and she loved to consume all kinds of stories and create her own. &nbsp;Lately these interest had been combining into creating comics of a sort, drawing her characters into stories she constructed as she went along, usually placing them in some point in the distant past on Earth, and trying to work out what life would be like for them and what challenges they would face. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her parents had accepted her interests different from her own with something of a shrug, figuring if this was the extent of the rebellion they could expect from her against her parents, they were getting off remarkably light. &nbsp;They were more pleased for her to have discovered some interests at all, than they were disappointed they were not the same as their own.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hey sweetie. &nbsp; We had a big day actually, very exciting.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh? &nbsp;Did they dig up something interesting on Earth?&rdquo; Maggie asked, now looking up at her mother.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, actually much bigger than that. &nbsp;We got our first message back from a Kobolian rift ship sent to another star system!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh? &nbsp;So&hellip; what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It means we have rift access to a whole new star system we&rsquo;ve never been to before, that <em>no</em> humans have ever been to before.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she looked down at her drawing, then looked back at Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are there aliens there?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like it, not even cellular life.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Maggie answered in disappointment before returning to her drawing, the conversation apparently over as far as she was concerned.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But! &nbsp; We&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn trailed off. &nbsp;She then gave up, putting her hands up with a smile on her face which said: &lsquo;oh forget it&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that moment the door opened and Jaren entered, prompting Maggie to get up, run over, and give him a big hub.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What am I? &nbsp; Chop liver?&rdquo; Kathryn asked her daughter, at which point Maggie released Jaren and turned to hug her mother even harder. &nbsp; Kathryn gave Jaren a wide eyed smirk as she slowly shook her head in amused disbelief. &nbsp;Maggie then released her mother and returned to sitting on her knees before the living room coffee table.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You get speak to the governments?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And, they&hellip; are in agreement. &nbsp;I thought it would be a lot harder, but it&rsquo;s just a survey mission and they said if we wanted it it was ours. &nbsp;A very exciting first time to a new star survey mission yes, but, well&hellip; to them just a survey mission nonetheless.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shook her head at him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I can remember when you felt exactly the same way, before the Earth expedition. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t see any value in pure research and exploration as the rest of your people and look at you now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well what can I say? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve been a good influence on me,&rdquo; he said with a grin before giving her a kiss.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ew.&rdquo; Maggie uttered in response to their kiss. &nbsp;They chose to ignore it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Jaren continued, &ldquo;New Horizon II has been recalled. &nbsp;They needed a few days to wrap up the studies they were conducting, but after that it&rsquo;ll take them ten days to get here through the rift.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Wow, it is a fast ship isn&rsquo;t it? &nbsp;It usually takes longer than that just to transit between the star and one of our worlds.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Um humm, state of the art.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it? &nbsp; We&rsquo;re really going?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yup?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Going where?&rdquo; Maggie asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her parents came over to where she was in the living room and sat on opposite sides of her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That new system I was telling you about,&rdquo; Kathryn explained, &ldquo;we pushed to be given the assignment ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;For fun! &nbsp; Because it&rsquo;s the kind of stuff we used to do before we settled down here to help Earth research get properly up and running and to raise you. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed our time here, and we certainly intend to come back to it, er-&ldquo; she looked at Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;We do intend to come back here and resume our positions here right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I certainly do, I certainly gave the governments the impression we were, that this was just a temporary reassignment for us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ok good, yes. &nbsp; We intend to carry on here after, but we just want to mix things up for a bit, get back out into there and see more of our little corner of the galaxy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked at Jaren and puffed out her cheeks before blowing the air out. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you say Jaren? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just an initial survey, probably want to spend two weeks at each primary body, so&hellip; what? &nbsp;Four or five months. &nbsp;Who would you like to stay with during that time? &nbsp;Uncle Francis? &nbsp;Antie Irvina maybe? &nbsp;Or Jaren&rsquo;s parents?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie wrinkled her nose. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m fourteen. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t need someone to look after me, I&rsquo;m not a baby.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not, of course, but you have to go somewhere, you can&rsquo;t just stay here on this station by yourself. &nbsp;You need to be on Haven or Kobol and I&rsquo;d be more comfortable if there was someone around keeping an eye on you is all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl looked down at her drawings. &nbsp;&ldquo;I should go with you,&rdquo; she surmised.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Jaren looked at each other with surprise. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;We never even considered&hellip; I mean it&rsquo;s really not that kind of a ship sweetie, it&rsquo;s not meant for families, it&rsquo;s a working ship, it&rsquo;s&hellip; practically military.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If I want to tell stories, I need see things to write about,&rdquo; the girl offered with a shrug.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Jaren were initially not enthusiastic about bringing their daughter on such a mission, but it was after all supposed to be a rather uneventful survey mission. &nbsp;Even if it was just for the sake of her art, they were heartened by her sudden interest in research and exploration regardless of its genesis.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You know Maggie, we&rsquo;ll be working a lot.&rdquo; Jaren cautiously warned her. &nbsp;&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much to do on the ship for fun, and if you come along you&rsquo;ll be expected to pull your own weight to some degree, you&rsquo;ll be assigned tasks and be expected to complete them professionally. &nbsp; Nothing you can&rsquo;t handle certainly and not a full work load, but that&rsquo;s the reality.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; she answered thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds like I&rsquo;d probably get bored if you didn&rsquo;t give me work to do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well what do you think Kat? &nbsp;If she&rsquo;s aware of all that I&rsquo;m sure I can get special authorization from Star Fleet Command.&rdquo; &nbsp; He was giving her a wide eye indicating his urging that Kathryn grant her assent.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you want to come work with us instead of hanging out in the city and catch up with your friends, maybe make some new ones, or maybe take art courses, or&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn really wanted to say yes, but she felt obligated to give her daughter every opportunity to consider changing her mind before finally saying yes. &nbsp; It was a relatively serious commitment for her, but one she was happy to let her make.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. &nbsp; You two both always talk about how much fun you had before coming here, and I want to see what that&rsquo;s like.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good enough for me!&rdquo; Kathryn said, finally able to let her enthusiasm for the idea go free.<br>&nbsp;</p>
