            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How <em>dare</em> you?&rdquo; Jaren demanded once they were alone after their conversation with Bill. &nbsp;&ldquo;How dare you so casually offer up to these aliens the entirety of my people&rsquo;s most precious resource?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sat on the bed and watched her husband angrily pace back and forth across the room. &nbsp; She understood his anger, but she was utterly unmoved by it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren it is neither mine to give nor yours to refuse. &nbsp;We will make our case to your political leadership and the decision will be theirs, not ours.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>We</em> will do no such thing, <em>I</em> will have <em>no part</em> in this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She&rsquo;d never seen him this angry. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d never seen him terribly angry much at in all the years she&rsquo;d known him. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t clear what exactly had put him in such a state.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well, then I will make the case myself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He stopped pacing and stood in front of her with his fists on his hips. &nbsp;&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t get it do you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. &nbsp; Explain it to me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren let out an exasperated sigh and resumed his pacing. &nbsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s head moved side to side as she watched him. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It was one thing to take part in their mission, one thing to give them what little we had with us for the chance to rescue our daughter, but this&hellip; this is something completely different.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;She was getting angry herself at being spoken to this way, but she was working hard to keep her cool. &nbsp;No good could come of both of them being in the state he was. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just on a larger scale. &nbsp;We gave them a bit of anti-matter to help them gain intel which would allow them to win the war. &nbsp;Now we want to give them a lot more to help them fight the war winning battle. &nbsp;In it that much, are we not in it completely? &nbsp; Is this not the logical next step? &nbsp; If this is unacceptable was not our original arrangement as well?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Small scale Kathryn, small scale. &nbsp;My people are not war mongers. &nbsp;You want to turn us into galactic war lords or arms dealers or something! &nbsp;It goes against everything my people stand for!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She chose to let that slide. &nbsp;For now. &nbsp; It was not okay for him to accuse her of having galactic warlord ambitions. &nbsp;She did stand now and could feel her calm ebbing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It goes against everything your people stand for?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice so far was still quite calm and composed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then why is it that your people are the only ones who have these weapons in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re the only ones who have developed anti-matter at all!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But your people have shared that technical information, yet Haven and Roma don&rsquo;t build any kind of heavy weapons, anti-matter or not.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it! &nbsp;If we give up all of our anti-matter we&rsquo;ll be utterly defenceless!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Defenceless? &nbsp; Against who?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>YOU!!</em>&rdquo; he cried. &nbsp;&ldquo;All of you offworlders! &nbsp;We cooperate and run Star Fleet together, but we always have to be wary of you other worlds turning on us! &nbsp;Yes we share but it never seems to be enough! &nbsp;We never know when the day comes where Haven and Roma decide we&rsquo;re not sharing enough and decide to <em>do</em> something about it! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we build weapons, to defend ourselves in case that day comes!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s anger had transmogrified into utter disbelief. &nbsp;&ldquo;You must be kidding. &nbsp;After all these years&hellip; after all the joint programs and missions&hellip; your people are <em>still</em> that paranoid? &nbsp;Jesus&hellip; I had no idea you were such a nationalist, such a partisan. &nbsp; I thought you believed in our cooperation as much as I did. &nbsp;I thought you believed in the unity between our worlds we&rsquo;ve been working on all these years. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re still&hellip; you <em>still</em> think we may turn on you at some point. &nbsp;Unbelievable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Somewhat shamed, Jaren calmed most of the anger out of his voice. &nbsp;The determination remained though. &nbsp;&ldquo;Contributing substantially to one side of a galactic civil war, contributing enough to turn the tide of the war, inserting ourselves in something so massive which we hardly understand at all, goes against everything I believe in, everything I believe my people stand for. &nbsp;Doing this will create blowback, unintended consequences, factors we can&rsquo;t even begin to anticipate.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And if we do nothing?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;How long before they come for us? &nbsp;They know we&rsquo;ve helped them already and they know where we live. &nbsp;Some day they <em>will</em> come, even if we go home now and bury our head in the sand. &nbsp;These people have been good to us. &nbsp;They have proven themselves reliable allies and friends to us. &nbsp; This is about more than the war Jaren, this is about more than the risk of being attacked by their enemy when they&rsquo;re no longer around to help us defend. &nbsp;This is about the future of humanity. &nbsp;Our alliance with the Bobbins opens up the <em>galaxy</em> for human beings! &nbsp;If we help them out this big, they&rsquo;d be forever in our debt. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing they wouldn&rsquo;t share with us. &nbsp;It would mean a whole new era of prosperity and development for humanity, but only if we help them now, when we can really make a difference for them. &nbsp;The alternative is to go home and wait for the day their enemy comes for us. &nbsp;<em>That</em>, I can&rsquo;t abide. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t live with that over my head if there&rsquo;s some way to prevent it now.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a lot of assumptions Kathryn.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And what about the vanquished? &nbsp;What about all of the enemy Bobbins who aren&rsquo;t slaughtered in the assault? &nbsp;What do you think will become of them?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I can only assume their Link will be deactivated and the leadership held accountable. &nbsp;A great many of them must be unwitting slaves to the permanent Link.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A <em>lot</em> of assumptions.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had had enough. &nbsp;She stood and assumed a defiant pose. &nbsp;&ldquo;Be that as it may, I have a professional obligation to report to Command the facts on the ground as I see them, and to offer my recommendations based on all the available information. &nbsp;In the end the decision won&rsquo;t be up to either of us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren waved at the wall to render a circular portal transparent. &nbsp;Through it the Bobbin home world grew larger and larger as they approached. &nbsp;&ldquo;I want nothing to do with it,&rdquo; he said firmly but quietly as he gazed out the window. &nbsp; &ldquo;Either way I&rsquo;m taking Maggie home and washing my hands of all of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren, I&hellip;&rdquo; she was frustrated but didn&rsquo;t want to leave things like this. &nbsp;&ldquo;I would have insisted you take Maggie home either way,&rdquo; she finally said. &nbsp;She looked at Jaren for what seemed like a long time, hoping he&rsquo;d look back at her and that they could have some sort rapprochement, some sort of eye contact which assured that despite their differences on this, in the end they&rsquo;d reconcile no matter what, that for better or worse they were still Kathryn and Jaren, and that they always would be. &nbsp;Eventually she realized she would get no such assurance from him and gave up.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go send my report to Command.&rdquo; she said coldly before waving the wall aside and leaving the room.</p>
