            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The door to the room Maggie was being kept melted away, and Margaret stood in the doorway. &nbsp; She was quiet for a time as she watched Kathryn and Jaren stroke her hair and gently touch her as she lay unconscious. &nbsp;They apparently hadn&rsquo;t noticed her there, or were too engrossed in their daughter to care to notice.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; the simulant woman asked as she entered the room and the door rematerialized behind her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Any change?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s almost woken up a few times,&rdquo; Jaren told her. &nbsp;&ldquo;She mutters sleepily but we can&rsquo;t make out what she&rsquo;s saying. &nbsp;She seems to be coming out of it just very slowly.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And how are you two holding up?&rdquo; she asked as she put a hand on each of their shoulders. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn reached up and wrapped her arm around Margaret&rsquo;s without looking up. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine Molly&hellip; I just want her to wake up,&rdquo; she said as she wiped a tear away from her eye.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girls eyes opened slightly, then widened a bit more. &nbsp;She blinked several times, but her eyes stayed narrower than usual as she adjusted to the light. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mom? &nbsp; Dad?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here Sweetie, you&rsquo;re safe. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; &nbsp; She turned to Margaret. &nbsp;&ldquo;How could they do this to a child?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fourteen&hellip;&rdquo; the girl croaked reflexively despite her condition. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not a child&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;She tried to sit up to throw her arms around her mother&rsquo;s shoulders but failed to traverse the distance and fell back down to the bed. &nbsp;Kathryn bent over to embrace her where she lay. &nbsp;&ldquo;Take your time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Not long after, when Maggie had fully recovered, and when their ship was halfway back to the Bobbin world from the star portal, she sat in a chair drawn out of the floor material with a blanket wrapped around her. &nbsp;Food and drink the Bobbins could provide were hit and miss to the human palette, but from the available options Jaren had managed to conjure up a hot drink which was sweet and flavourful, thought what flavour it reminded of no one could quite pin down.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn, Jaren, Margaret, and Bill all sat in front of the girl as she took her first few sips and composed herself to recount what had happened to her. &nbsp;She had jumped in fright when Bill had entered the room. &nbsp;After all, the only Bobbins she had seen so far had been the ones who had captured and imprisoned her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; was in my suite when they attacked our ship. &nbsp;I heard the general alarm sound, but&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the first time and there was nothing I was supposed to do but stay where I was. &nbsp;A few minutes later a circle on the wall started glowing bright orange and yellow, then it melted away and slagged on the ground. &nbsp;Three&hellip; aliens like&hellip; that one,&rdquo; she pointed at Bill, &ldquo;captured me. &nbsp;They threw a ball of dark material at me, and when it hit me it spread out and enveloped my whole body. &nbsp;When it hit my face I was sure I would suffocate under it, but somehow I was able to breathe normally. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t see anything out it, and I never could feel being moved in any way, but I was in there for a long time. &nbsp;How long I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; the girl admitted after taking a drink of the hot liquid. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so scared in my life, being entombed like that, totally helpless&hellip;&rdquo; she had a distant look in her eyes which made Kathryn very uncomfortable, with an edge of anger which she could feel becoming more prominent the more Margaret spoke.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Finally the material pulled away from me again and reformed into a ball which left my chest and floated over to the nearest wall and was absorbed into it. &nbsp;It was then that I realized that the entire room I was in was made of the same material as the ball which had covered me. &nbsp; Very soon after I felt a warmth and saw only bright and became unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Wand stun?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Bill.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Through a mirror ball he responded after nodding somberly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not necessarily from a wand, but yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Maggie asked uncomfortably.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend,&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story but of their species there are bad guys and good guys. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s one of the good guys and we&rsquo;re on his ship. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when you&rsquo;re done with your own story okay?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; the girl shrugged. &nbsp;She now seemed uncomfortable, somehow reluctant to continue with her story.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;When I woke up again&hellip;&rdquo; she looked at each face in the room with her for several moments, as though she were trying to reassure herself that it was okay to speak openly about what she had endured. &nbsp;&ldquo;When I woke up I was tied to a table, naked&hellip; spread eagle. &nbsp;There was no one in the room with me, but a bright light was coming from above. &nbsp;It was&hellip; hard to open my eyes it was so bright. &nbsp;The restraints prevented me from moving at all. &nbsp;It seemed like hours that I was left alone like that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn was trying very hard to mask the look of horrified anger in her face and eyes, but she wasn&rsquo;t altogether successful and she could see in Maggie&rsquo;s eyes that she saw it and Kathryn renewed her efforts to contain her expression but continued to fail.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Eventually some aliens came in. &nbsp;They started taking&hellip; samples. &nbsp;Blood, urine, hair, swabs from all over&hellip; the next time they came back they took a skin sample from here.&rdquo; &nbsp;She pulled the blanket away and pulled the side of her pants down just enough to show the scar on her side below her hip where they had cut a piece out of her. &nbsp; It was minor, a few centimeters squared, but to see it Kathryn felt anger as though they had amputated a limb.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl wrapped herself back up and took another drink of the now cooling beverage. &nbsp; &ldquo;For several days after that they did scans. &nbsp;When they were taking samples they used three of those mirrored balls that thing is talking through,&rdquo; she was referring to Bill, &ldquo;but after the samples they left them floating around my head for what must have been days, presumably scanning my brain activity. &nbsp;After that they started asking questions.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What about food and drink?&rdquo; her father asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Soon after I was strapped down one of them came in to offer me water through a straw. &nbsp; Once they figured out for sure that that was what I needed, they mounted a straw beside my head from out of the wall and I could drink whenever I wanted. &nbsp;Food was&hellip; harder for them to figure out. &nbsp;From time to time they&rsquo;d bring in stuff I couldn&rsquo;t recognize and put it in front of my face. &nbsp;I was too scared to try it at first, but eventually&hellip; eventually I did take small bites to see what it was like. &nbsp;I spit it out, it was disgusting. &nbsp;Over the next few days thought they&rsquo;d bring in other things and have me try them. &nbsp; Eventually they found something I could eat and would bring it regularly. &nbsp;I think their scanning helped them figure out what my body needed, or at least&hellip; what it would accept.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They were asking questions?&rdquo; Kathryn tried to redirect her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes&hellip; things I didn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;There was a lot I didn&rsquo;t know how they could know that much to ask more questions, but they already knew a lot.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They took the New Horizon II&rsquo;s computer core at the same time they took you,&rdquo; Margaret informed her. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how they knew what they knew.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ah. &nbsp;I figured something like that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They asked me a lot about anti-matter. &nbsp;They seemed frustrated that I didn&rsquo;t know anything, that I might be lying, that they should have taken someone who knew more&hellip;&rdquo; she took another drink as she thought.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They asked me about Earth&hellip; about all our worlds, about our defences, about our anti-matter reserves, about where our planets are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There must have been a lot they couldn&rsquo;t access on the core,&rdquo; Kathryn said quietly to Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how advanced they are, some quantum encryption is just flat out impenetrable.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jaren only nodded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then, at some point, they released me from the restraints,&rdquo; the girls said as matter-of-factly as she could. &nbsp;&ldquo;The examination table melted into the floor, and the room reconfigured into what it was when you found me. &nbsp;I found my clothes and put them back on&hellip; at least there was that. &nbsp;For several days I was just happy to be free of the restraints and clothed again&hellip; but eventually I started making noise. &nbsp;I started yelling and banging. &nbsp;I started figuring out the motion controls for the wall and floor material. &nbsp;At one point I was able to pull apart the wall enough to climb through. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think they were expecting that.&rdquo; &nbsp;She had a smirk and look in her eye which Jaren knew all too well in Kathryn. &nbsp;She was proud of herself that she&rsquo;d proven more trouble for the aliens than they&rsquo;d expected. &nbsp;He looked over at his wife and saw a similar look on her face. &nbsp;She was also proud of her daughter for not making things easy for her captors.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Anyway, after that incident, they knocked me out again like they did on New Horizon II, and I&rsquo;ve been left unconscious pretty much ever since until you rescued me. &nbsp; When I did wake up I found water and what was passing for food at that point&hellip; but when I was done eating and drinking I was hit with the knock out ray or whatever again. &nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s how you found me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded, indicating that yes, this is how they&rsquo;d found her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s with the alien here? &nbsp;How did you get mixed up with them? &nbsp;Where&rsquo;s the ship and everyone else?&rdquo; &nbsp;She seemed justifiably concerned that the ship had been destroyed or something.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s fine Maggie, well&hellip; we lost a few people in the attack where you were captured, but you didn&rsquo;t know any of them. &nbsp;Everyone else took the ship back to Earth to report in and get everyone home safe when we had the chance. &nbsp;We stayed behind to help our new friends and rescue you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not with the ones who took me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp; They&rsquo;re in the middle of a big civil war. &nbsp;These aliens, we call them Bobbins, have been very good to us. &nbsp;We never could have rescued you without their help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl seemed unsure. &nbsp;All of her experience so far of these aliens was hostile and abusive. &nbsp;It would take some time for her to get used to the idea of there being &lsquo;good ones&rsquo;. &nbsp;Nevertheless, on her mother&rsquo;s word she was at least willing to accept the principle. &nbsp; &ldquo;I know it may seem silly, but I&rsquo;m still very tired. &nbsp;Somehow I don&rsquo;t think being knocked out that way really gets you what you get from sleep.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course sweetie,&rdquo; Kathryn uttered as she and Jaren stood up. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t have had any decent sleep in weeks. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re a few hours away from the Bobbin homeworld, but there&rsquo;s no reason to disembark right away. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll get out of here and let you get some rest. &nbsp;When you wake up we should be ready to go home.&rdquo; She approached her daughter and put her arm around her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Before you know it you&rsquo;ll be sleeping in your own bed again,&rdquo; she told her as she brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren began ushering Bill and Margaret out of the room. &nbsp;He then came over and gave Maggie a lingering hug before taking Kathryn&rsquo;s hand and leading her away too. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get some rest Maggie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be here when you wake up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The four stood outside the wall which had reappeared after they&rsquo;d left Maggie&rsquo;s room. &nbsp; Jaren let out a long heavy sigh. &nbsp; &ldquo;Well&hellip; it could have been worse.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Instinctively Kathryn breathed fire at him with her eyes, but then caught herself and tried to convince herself that he was right. &nbsp;She was livid at what they had subjected her daughter to, but in the final analysis yes, it could have been much worse. &nbsp;They had her back, and physically at least, she was fine. &nbsp;She found herself wondering how long she&rsquo;d have nightmares about what had happened to her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At least we hurt them,&rdquo; Margaret said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Taking all that data must have been a serious blow to their war effort. &nbsp; Finding out good intel Bill?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The alien hadn&rsquo;t said a word so far. &nbsp;It had a distant look in its big black eyes. &nbsp;It seemed to shudder as it regarded them after being addressed, as though he&rsquo;d been lost in something else and jarred to the here and now.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, the information was&hellip; very illuminating.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But not good.&rdquo; Margaret stated, reading between the lines.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well out with it,&rdquo; the simulant demanded in frustration. &nbsp;She was also clearly shaken by what had happened to Maggie. &nbsp;Far worse had happened to her back on Earth in the before time, but that was her, not a young girl she was so fond of.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our enemy is far stronger than we originally thought. &nbsp;We mistook the limited nature of their direct aggression for a capacity gap. &nbsp; In reality they have been gathering resources and building up forces in secret. &nbsp;At this point they have more ships than we do. &nbsp;Not by a lot, but more, and they continue to build. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s worse&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They realized about anti-matter right away. &nbsp;Within hours of beginning analysis of your computer core they saw the data about your encounter with our portal ship and realized the effectiveness of anti-matter warheads against our vessels. &nbsp;They immediately began constructing research and production facilities and they are weeks ahead of us. &nbsp;They already have a strategic reserve which threatens our existence.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is little we can do,&rdquo; Bill admitted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Their strategic advantage is too great. &nbsp;We cannot win.&rdquo; &nbsp;His bluntness was disarming. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is currently a raucous debate in the chamber where we agreed to the mission to infiltrate their link. &nbsp;Despite empty protest, there is only one option available to us now given our assured defeat. &nbsp;We escape.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Escape?&rdquo; Margaret asked incredulously. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where can you go where they can&rsquo;t follow? &nbsp;You know they&rsquo;ll never stop pursuing you, and anywhere you go they can follow.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is not entirely accurate,&rdquo; Bill cryptically responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will travel to the Andromeda galaxy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren was in utter disbelief. &nbsp;&ldquo;What? &nbsp; How? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s over two million light years away! &nbsp;Even at the speed of light&hellip; there&rsquo;s certainly no way to portal there, the amount of energy you would need would be&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He had trouble finishing his sentences. &nbsp;His engineering brain was cycling through all the possible methods and excluding them one by one.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Astronomical.&rdquo; Bill said. &nbsp;&ldquo;The amount of energy required would be astronomical, yes. &nbsp;But we have a way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Jaren demanded, half in disbelief, half indignant.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hypernova,&rdquo; Bill explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;Within our territory there is a large star on the verge of going hypernova. &nbsp;We expend a great deal of energy maintaining it on the edge of collapse and preventing it from completing its phase change. &nbsp; We have massively powerful energy collectors about the star. &nbsp;The extreme polar energy jets will be harnessed ninety six percent and it will be enough, just barely but enough, to open a portal to Andromeda without a receiving gate. &nbsp;Portal travel is possible without a receiving gate, but the energy to spontaneously force open an ungated portal are tenfold, more than any single star can output for us to perform within this galaxy, hence the portal drone ships. &nbsp;The energy required to travel that far is an additional extreme energy requirement, but the polar energy jets of hypernovae such as this one are the most concentrated energy produced anywhere in the universe. &nbsp; Before the war we were recruiting and planning for an expedition to our neighboring galaxy, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a one way trip,&rdquo; Jaren finished his thought, now understanding. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;We had volunteers&hellip; brave Bobbins who wanted to push the boundaries and leave home forever, but&hellip; the war distracted us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s people like that who came to our planets,&rdquo; Kathryn reflected. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was a one way trip for them as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is the true unknown,&rdquo; Bill offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We knew we may encounter aliens even more advanced than ourselves and that we may be unwelcome, or there could be none and the entire galaxy theirs for the taking. &nbsp; It was a massive expedition, hundreds of portal drone ships would have gone with them to begin the slow process of seeding the galaxy with a portal network, everything they would need to establish a thriving central world like this one, but&hellip; the war.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Kathryn offered in understanding.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; Margaret demanded. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just going to give up and abandon this galaxy to the monsters you helped create.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Margaret.&rdquo; Kathryn said in an authoritative voice.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Bill offered with a three taloned wave of his hand to Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;We see no other option. &nbsp;We are certainly open to suggestions, but all of our simulations show, with the information we&rsquo;ve obtained in our raid, that there is no way for us to win this war. &nbsp;We will be destroyed, and all survivors will be enslaved by their Link. &nbsp;We see no alternative options to escaping while we still can. &nbsp;Hypernovae are so rare they will not be able to follow.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What would that mean for us?&rdquo; Margaret asked. &nbsp;Bill just looked at her quizzically. &nbsp;&ldquo;You abandon the galaxy, but we&rsquo;re left behind. &nbsp;They know where we are, they can come for us at any time, and they know we&rsquo;ve helped you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This is all true. &nbsp;However there is nothing we can do for you without risking our own extinction.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Everyone was quiet for a long few moments as they considered the gravity of their situation. &nbsp; Finally Kathryn turned to Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren. &nbsp; How much anti-matter could Kobol provide in an emergency? &nbsp;Total, across the whole system. &nbsp;If they stripped every ship, energy plant, production facility and weapon, how much.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what that has to do with anything.&rdquo; &nbsp;As soon as she asked he knew exactly what she was thinking and he wanted no part in it whatsoever.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; she asked again in a demanding and impatient tone.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He glared at her for a good long while but finally answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Five or six hundred kilos.&rdquo; &nbsp;His voice was shaky with anger.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned to Bill. &nbsp;&ldquo;What could your people do with five hundred kilos of anti-matter?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The alien seemed confused and excited at the same time. &nbsp;&ldquo;Win the war,&rdquo; he answered simply through his mirror ball, &ldquo;if we act fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
