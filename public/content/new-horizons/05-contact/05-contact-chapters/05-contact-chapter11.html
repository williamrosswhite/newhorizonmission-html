            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Defensive systems&hellip; offline.</em>&rdquo; the voice declared, and the four sighed a breath of relief. &nbsp;Even the perpetually unflappable Margaret was visibly relieved. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>What is your purpose here?</em>&rdquo; the voice asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We came to see if we could help you.&rdquo; Kathryn answered, not sure where to look as she did.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Help?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;We thought there might be life forms here in need of assistance after&hellip; after our exchange.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am the only life form here.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo; Margaret inquired with uncharacteristic sincerity, siding up beside the central projection. &nbsp;She seemed to be making assumptions the others had yet to, such as this central projection being the source of the intelligence they were communicating with.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am&hellip; this ship.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And your mission?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>To establish a portal system in this star system.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I can now no longer complete my mission. &nbsp; Systems are&hellip; damaged beyond repair.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what will you do now?&rdquo; Maggie asked. &nbsp;From the tone of her voice it was clear she had sympathy for it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took a moment for it to respond this time, but it finally did. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Nothing.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They all understood. &nbsp;There was nothing to do. &nbsp;It could no longer manoeuver, no longer complete its mission, it was unknown if it could even contact home. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s singular purpose was thwarted, now there was nothing for it to do but float here into eternity, a failure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;What people sent you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am from a planet&hellip; with no translation in your language.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How far away?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Based on the metrics in your original transmission, the home planet of the builders is fifty-two-point-eight thousand light-years away.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You travelled <em>that</em> far?&rdquo; Felix asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;It must have taken you eons!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Not directly, no.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Kathryn demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I was dispatched through the nearest portal.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And how far away was that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Eighteen-point-6 light-years.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And how long did that take you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Twenty-six-point-three years by the metrics you provided.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Ask it if they will now send another ship like this one</em>,&rdquo; Jaren asked in her ear.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Will they send another when you fail to establish contact?&rdquo; Kathryn asked the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Yes.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn thought on that one. &nbsp;&ldquo;What should we call you? &nbsp;Do you have a name?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I have no name. &nbsp;I am the ship.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright then I&rsquo;m going to call you Ralph. &nbsp;Ralph, do you bear us any further hostility.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>My mission is now impossible. &nbsp;Action of any kind is no longer required.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it. &nbsp; Ralph we have a lot of questions and you seem to have a lot of answers. &nbsp;Would you like to come with us instead of floating here until the end of time? &nbsp; Is it even possible to take you with us, to remove you from the ship?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>I am the ship.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand, but is what I&rsquo;m asking possible?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Yes. &nbsp;This unit is removable for service and replaceable if necessary.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Great. &nbsp; Are you willing to allow us to detach you and bring you over to our ship so we can talk to you and learn more about you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>This is not my mission.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand that, but would you protest if we did so.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The voice paused. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>There would be no cause to.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Again, I&rsquo;ll take it. &nbsp;Can you talk us through disconnecting you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>There is no need.</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;In the vacuum nothing could be heard, but the saw the module shudder ever so slightly and begin floating away from the wall where it had been mounted. &nbsp;When it did so, everything else in the interior went back to the dead and dark state they&rsquo;d found it in. &nbsp;The module retained its blue glow from between its small fins, casting a hauntingly faint blue light on everything. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>I am equipped with maneuvering thrusters,</em>&rdquo; it explained.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;re bringing that thing over here?</em>&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an incredible opportunity and it seems willing to answer our questions. &nbsp;And Jaren we have so many. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather&hellip; interview it on our own ground than stay out here until our air almost runs out.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren paused before answering, &ldquo;I agree. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll start working on setting up an isolation laboratory right away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; she asked the module, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have any secret evil plans or weapons of the doomsday or any other variety hidden inside you do you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>No.</em>&rdquo; it answered plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn could only shrug and take it at its word. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, well why don&rsquo;t you follow along behind us. &nbsp;Maggie you&rsquo;re up first, then me, Felix, Margaret, and then Ralph.&rdquo; &nbsp;Everyone acknowledged that they understood.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The trip back was as uneventful as the first, and one by one they piled into the airlock through the outer door. &nbsp;With the four of them and the module it was remarkably cramped, but before long atmosphere was restored and their suites loosened up accordingly. &nbsp;The inner door opened, and Jaren was floating there to meet them along with four engineering crewmembers. &nbsp;Kathryn noticed that all of them were armed. &nbsp;Jaren could be such a worrier.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix we&rsquo;ve taken over the main research lab for this, hope you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Jaren informed him. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly not going to be working on anything else now.&rdquo; &nbsp;He was wearing a giant grin. &nbsp;Nothing gave him a charge more than the opportunity to study advanced technology.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get Ralph to the lab and secure him in place. &nbsp;Once we have Jaren please have the pilot ready to burn us back towards the sun at one gee.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Are we really calling it Ralph?&rdquo; Maggie asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Until it chooses another name for itself, yes,&rdquo; her mother answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading home then?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;We went out on a limb going this far without returning to base. &nbsp;We <em>have</em> to now. &nbsp;Besides, we should be getting a very strongly worded response back from Command any minute now if we haven&rsquo;t already.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t yet,&rdquo; Jaren informed her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good. &nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get Ralph situated and let&rsquo;s get underway. &nbsp;They will no doubt have answered by then, and I&rsquo;ll have time to deal with the fallout.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Jaren confirmed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How long will it take us to get home?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At one gee a little less than two days to fall towards this star, and a little more than four to climb back up to Earth.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Great. &nbsp; When everything&rsquo;s squared away on the bridge, you&rsquo;re welcome to join us in the lab.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren nodded and turned away towards the bridge but Kathryn grabbed his arm and stopped him after looking over at the module. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Make it one-point-two gees,&rdquo; she corrected with a note of caution in her voice.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo;</p>
