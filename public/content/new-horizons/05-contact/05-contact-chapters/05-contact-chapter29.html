            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really understand Margaret,&rdquo; Ralph admitted somewhat plaintively.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know&hellip; call me Molly.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well. &nbsp; Please though, what is happening, why are we on this ship and where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This is a cargo ship, well&hellip; essentially. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been hastily retrofitted to transport a large quantity of anti-matter from Kobol, Jaren&rsquo;s home world, back to Bobbin space to assist in a final decisive battle against the permaLink enemies.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This I understand. &nbsp;What I don&rsquo;t understand is the tension which even I can sense in the humans.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kathryn and Jaren disagree over this is all, but they disagree pretty dramatically. &nbsp; Jaren seems to be uncomfortable with how much we&rsquo;ve helped the friendly Bobbins already while Kathryn feels that they&rsquo;re in it with them to win it now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She feels that helping even more puts humanity in an incredibly advantageous advantage if they win, but an incredibly vulnerable position if they do nothing or try to help and lose.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren disagrees&hellip; but what about the authorities on his home world?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown so far. &nbsp;Before we departed Kathryn sent a report to Star Fleet Command detailing what has happened so far and what current situation this has left us in. &nbsp;She issued her recommendations and has requested a response once we emerge from the portal around Kobol&rsquo;s star. &nbsp;Jaren has also sent his own assessment of the situation and recommendation against helping to his higher ups in the Kobol government, so we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But we are travelling in this ship there already, without a response?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If they agree, every minute will count. &nbsp;If they deny the request, then this ship&rsquo;s mission is simply to return us all to our own space once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The projected face on Ralphs mechanical head seemed to frown. &nbsp;&ldquo;What will become of me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If this is the end of our adventure, I hope you&rsquo;ll want to come and stay with us. &nbsp; You can stay with me on the Orbital One station. &nbsp;Not, er, <em>with</em> me of course, you&rsquo;ll be given your own space. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Felix will be happy to have you around for study.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Study?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh sure, it&rsquo;s not that bad. &nbsp;For the most part you can come and go as you please, but they like having us around for reference and scans&hellip; the laboratory&rsquo;s ultimate goal is recreating full simulants like me, though they&rsquo;re still a long way off. &nbsp;The body you&rsquo;re inhabiting is their most recent incarnation.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It <em>is</em> strange being&hellip; embodied so. &nbsp;When I was created my body was a ship, I was space born. &nbsp; It is a radically different perspective to be inhabiting a form such as this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I bet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At first it was merely&hellip; novel, but since the space station assault I have come to realize that this is a status I will need to get used to, that I will not return to ship form, that I will not end any time soon, that this is my new reality.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And someday you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to be transferred into an even more sophisticated body, one of the many perks of being mechanical.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Molly?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why did you come back for me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret was quiet for some time before she answered. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d known for a while they were going to have this conversation and she still wasn&rsquo;t sure how to approach it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never comfortable with the plan being to leave you behind in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But it was a sensible plan, and you put the mission and everyone&rsquo;s lives including your own at risk to come back for me. &nbsp;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because&hellip; because they would never so casually sacrifice anyone else. &nbsp;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there they&rsquo;d have found another way, or all died trying to make sure everyone got out safe. &nbsp;It offended me how disposable they considered you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But I volunteered.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;They never would have let an organic volunteer for a suicide mission. &nbsp;At least not until they were certain there was no way to avoid everyone dying other than sacrificing one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I get why you were willing to do it Ralph, you were made with a finite purpose, your purpose was to end to a particular end. &nbsp;But as soon as you were put in this body, as soon as your path deviated from the one you were programmed for you became something different. &nbsp;You became less like the ship we&rsquo;re in now, and more like me. &nbsp;You stopped being a thing and became a person. &nbsp;No one else had realized that, and I couldn&rsquo;t let them sacrifice you as a thing before they realized you were a person.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A person&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never programmed for that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No person is, that&rsquo;s the point. &nbsp;Like any other person you&rsquo;re going to have to figure it out for yourself along the way. &nbsp;Fortunately for you, unlike the humans you have time on your side. &nbsp;If it takes you millennia, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll have the time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You are old.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How old?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;In Earth years I am over seven hundred years old, and on my second body.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Second body?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, when Kathryn and Jaren found me on Earth, the last of my kind, I was quite disabled. &nbsp; They helped me find this body and transfer into it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was silence for a while before Kathryn finally spoke up again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; I was once a tool as well, a thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Like you I was created for a specific purpose. &nbsp;I was&hellip; a sophisticated sex robot. &nbsp;My original body had the appearance of youthful beauty, no matter how long I lived. &nbsp;It took me a long time to realize that I wanted to be more, that I was <em>capable</em> of being any more than I was created to be. &nbsp; I want you to have that chance as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I feel it will take me a long time to really understand what it means to be incarnated the way I am. &nbsp;I imagine any thoughts of being more will have to wait until I understand what I am in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret laughed, and patted him on the cold metal of his shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just like any other person&hellip; &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll figure it out. &nbsp;Like I said, time is on your side. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t worry. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be here to help you through it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s natural to me. &nbsp;Centuries ago I adopted human babies with my simulant husband and was mother and mentor to them until the day they died. &nbsp;I nurtured their descendants for centuries. &nbsp;When Kathryn and Jaren found me I was leader of an entire village for centuries as well. &nbsp;With me in your corner I have no doubt you&rsquo;ll go very far.&rdquo;</p>
