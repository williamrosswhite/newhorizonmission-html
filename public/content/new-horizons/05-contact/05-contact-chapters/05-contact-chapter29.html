            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really understand Margaret,&rdquo; Ralph admitted somewhat plaintively.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know&hellip; call me Molly.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well. &nbsp;Please though, what is happening, why are we on this ship and where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This is a cargo ship, well&hellip; essentially. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been hastily retrofitted to transport a large quantity of anti-matter from Kobol, Jaren&rsquo;s home world, back to Bobbin space to assist in a final decisive battle against the permaLink enemies.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This I understand. &nbsp;What I don&rsquo;t understand is the tension which even I can sense in the humans.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kathryn and Jaren disagree over this is all, but they disagree pretty dramatically. &nbsp;Jaren seems to be uncomfortable with how much we&rsquo;ve helped the friendly Bobbins already while Kathryn feels that they&rsquo;re in it with them to win it now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She feels that helping even more puts humanity in an incredibly advantageous advantage if they win, but an incredibly vulnerable position if they do nothing or try to help and lose.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren disagrees&hellip; but what about the authorities on his home world?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown so far. &nbsp;Before we departed Kathryn sent a report to Star Fleet Command detailing what has happened so far and what current situation this has left us in. &nbsp;She issued her recommendations and has requested a response once we emerge from the portal around Kobol&rsquo;s star. &nbsp;Jaren has also sent his own assessment of the situation and recommendation against helping to his higher ups in the Kobol government, so we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But we are travelling in this ship there already, without a response?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If they agree, every minute will count. &nbsp;If they deny the request, then this ship&rsquo;s mission is simply to return us all to our own space once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The projected face on Ralphs mechanical head seemed to frown. &nbsp;&ldquo;What will become of me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If this is the end of our adventure, I hope you&rsquo;ll want to come and stay with us. &nbsp;You can stay with me on the Orbital One station. &nbsp;Not, er, <em>with</em> me of course, you&rsquo;ll be given your own space. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure Felix will be happy to have you around for study.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Study?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh sure, it&rsquo;s not that bad. &nbsp;For the most part you can come and go as you please, but they like having us around for reference and scans&hellip; the laboratory&rsquo;s ultimate goal is recreating full simulants like me, though they&rsquo;re still a long way off. &nbsp;The body you&rsquo;re inhabiting is their most recent incarnation.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It <em>is</em> strange being&hellip; embodied so. &nbsp;When I was created my body was a ship, I was space born. &nbsp;It is a radically different perspective to be inhabiting a form such as this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I bet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At first it was merely&hellip; novel, but since the space station assault I have come to realize that this is a status I will need to get used to, that I will not return to ship form, that I will not end any time soon, that this is my new reality.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And someday you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to be transferred into an even more sophisticated body, one of the many perks of being mechanical.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Molly?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why did you come back for me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret was quiet for some time before she answered. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d known for a while they were going to have this conversation and she still wasn&rsquo;t sure how to approach it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never comfortable with the plan being to leave you behind in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But it was a sensible plan, and you put the mission and everyone&rsquo;s lives including your own at risk to come back for me. &nbsp;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because&hellip; because they would never so casually sacrifice anyone else. &nbsp;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there they&rsquo;d have found another way, or all died trying to make sure everyone got out safe. &nbsp;It offended me how disposable they considered you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But I volunteered.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;They never would have let an organic volunteer for a suicide mission. &nbsp;At least not until they were certain there was no way to avoid everyone dying other than sacrificing one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I get why you were willing to do it Ralph, you were made with a finite purpose, your purpose was to end to a particular end. &nbsp;But as soon as you were put in this body, as soon as your path deviated from the one you were programmed for you became something different. &nbsp;You became less like the ship we&rsquo;re in now, and more like me. &nbsp;You stopped being a thing and became a person. &nbsp;No one else had realized that, and I couldn&rsquo;t let them sacrifice you as a thing before they realized you were a person.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A person&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never programmed for that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;No person is, that&rsquo;s the point. &nbsp;Like any other person you&rsquo;re going to have to figure it out for yourself along the way. &nbsp;Fortunately for you, unlike the humans you have time on your side. &nbsp;If it takes you millennia, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll have the time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You are old.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How old?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;In Earth years I am over seven hundred years old, and on my second body.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Second body?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, when Kathryn and Jaren found me on Earth, the last of my kind, I was quite disabled. &nbsp;They helped me find this body and transfer into it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was silence for a while before Kathryn finally spoke up again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; I was once a tool as well, a thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Like you I was created for a specific purpose. &nbsp;I was&hellip; a sophisticated sex robot. &nbsp;My original body had the appearance of youthful beauty, no matter how long I lived. &nbsp;It took me a long time to realize that I wanted to be more, that I was <em>capable</em> of being any more than I was created to be. &nbsp;I want you to have that chance as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I feel it will take me a long time to really understand what it means to be incarnated the way I am. &nbsp;I imagine any thoughts of being more will have to wait until I understand what I am in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret laughed, and patted him on the cold metal of his shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just like any other person&hellip; &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll figure it out. &nbsp;Like I said, time is on your side. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t worry. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be here to help you through it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s natural to me. &nbsp;Centuries ago I adopted human babies with my simulant husband and was mother and mentor to them until the day they died. &nbsp;I nurtured their descendants for centuries. &nbsp;When Kathryn and Jaren found me I was leader of an entire village for centuries as well. &nbsp;With me in your corner I have no doubt you&rsquo;ll go very far.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that man!&rdquo; Kathryn exclaimed after Patricia melted the wall door to her suite away in response to the Captain knocking on it. &nbsp;As soon as the door opened, Kathryn stormed across the room and collapsed onto the Bobbin&rsquo;s facsimile of a chair, throwing an arm over her eyes in exasperation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia held a mug of shadow material with both hands which emitted steam up towards and around her face as she sat down on an adjacent couch. &nbsp;She carefully repositioned the robe she was wearing and must have brought with her, tightening the sashe and taking care to cover her chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusual for you to come to me in moments of frustration with your husband,&rdquo; she observed. &nbsp;Her practiced air of standoffish innocence was generally quite convincing, but Kathryn had known her a long time. &nbsp;Patricia had grown up as a kind of royalty, adopted personally by Margaret to be her emissary and personal servant when she was revered as something more like a god but trapped in place relying on the energy from a surviving hydro-electric dam to sustain her original body.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sat up, propping herself up on both sides with her hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s different this time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Different?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her eyes widened so imperceptibly someone who knew her less well might not have noticed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Maybe&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;ve finally realized it&rsquo;s never going to really work with us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worked fairly well for a long time Kat, I&rsquo;ve seen you like this before.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different this time. &nbsp;I was wrong about him, he&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t trust us, he doesn&rsquo;t trust me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, bolting to her feet and Patricia watched as she stormed over to the window. &nbsp;She put her arm above it and rested her forehead on it as she looked out the window at the nothingness of space. &nbsp;&ldquo;I expected him to be reluctant to go with the plan, to advise our governments to get in this fight and supply the Bobbins with every gram of antimatter we have. &nbsp;I knew he was a pacifist at heart, that part didn&rsquo;t surprise me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But more than that he&rsquo;s still infected with the spirit of his people. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s worried about Kobol being defenseless against the other colonies if they turn over all of their most powerful weapons! &nbsp;Can you believe that!?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the woman answered plainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned around with an expression which was more confusion than hurt or offense.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;In the years I have served Margaret, I have seen many former allies turn enemy. &nbsp;It is not uncommon. &nbsp;In fact it was one of the earliest crises we faced together. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d had peaceful relations with a neighboring tribe the Dakelh for generations. &nbsp;They were likewise based around a different hydroelectric dam in the region and we helped each other keep both operating however we could, it was mutually beneficial. &nbsp;But one day their last turbine failed and was beyond anyone&rsquo;s ability to repair.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia seemed to be looking well past the bulkhead, deep into space in her mind&rsquo;s eye. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know it had happened until they came in force and ambushed us one day. &nbsp;In their mind they had no choice, it was conquer us and take what was ours or die. &nbsp;They could have survived without electricity like others scattered around the world. &nbsp;They could have asked to be welcomed into our society; in the aftermath the survivor&rsquo;s were. &nbsp;But they were scared. &nbsp;Many of them felt that we might attack them preemptively if we learned of the failure of their dam, but&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She grew quiet for a moment but Kathryn waited for her to finish her thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;There was a girl, Isapoinhkyaki&hellip;&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Isa&hellip;&rdquo; she added more softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;On an earlier visit I got to know her better and she was my&hellip;&rdquo; she shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;When they came they all came, with any weapon they could find. &nbsp;The temple, the dam, was their target. &nbsp;She knew how to find us, I&rsquo;d shown her around. &nbsp;I&hellip;&rdquo; tears started to well up in her eyes before she lowered her head to wipe them away and steeled herself. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I had to kill her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been my lover and I had to kill her because at that point it was them or us, her or me, and I had to defend our leader and the facility which sustained her.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn came to her side and put her arm around her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Patricia, I had no idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why would you?&rdquo; she asked, without looking towards her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never brought it up. &nbsp;The point is that yes, I understand where Jaren is coming from.&rdquo; &nbsp;At this point she met Kathryn&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; she clarified, &ldquo;both about the direness of our situation and the trustworthiness of the other colonies, but I understand. &nbsp;His people left Earth because they felt they were being persecuted. &nbsp;Their way of life, legitimate or not, was under threat. &nbsp;That kind of thing gets baked into a society. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we responded so aggressively when your people showed up on our own doorstep, the scar of that day left us unable, or at least unwilling, to trust anyone with the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had nothing to say in response. &nbsp;She was still angry, but understood what Patricia was saying. &nbsp;When she finally had something to say, it was only: &ldquo;He should be able to trust <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia smiled and resuming her gaze deep into space put a comforting hand on Kathryn&rsquo;s knee. &nbsp;&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Before really understanding what she was doing or why, Kathryn turned her face to Patricia&rsquo;s and moved to try to kiss her. &nbsp;Patricia bolted to her feed and stared at her with impossibly wide eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I, I&hellip; I thought-&ldquo; Kathryn stammered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You thought wrong.&rdquo; Patricia stated flatly to cut her off. &nbsp;Her eyes darted back and forth, scrutinizing Kathryn&rsquo;s eyes individually, searching for something. &nbsp;&ldquo;I will not be your rebound. &nbsp;I will not be your thing to experiment with while you&rsquo;re angry at your husband just for you to reconcile with him and try to pretend it never happened.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That was not my intent,&rdquo; Kathryn insisted. &nbsp;She had the scared feeling that she&rsquo;d irreparably lost or broken something. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; oh God Patricia, I didn&rsquo;t mean to- Fuck I&rsquo;m so sorry, I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Seeming satisfied for the moment that Kathryn felt adequately bad for her behaviour, she sat back down beside her. &nbsp;She took her hand in both of hers and held her eye contact with her enormous brown eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I care for you Kathryn, I always have, you were captivating from that first day you woke up in my tent, your curiosity so easily overwhelming the danger. &nbsp;Under different circumstances I would be willing to explore this, but not like this,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sort yourself out. &nbsp;If things can be repaired with Jaren, if you want them to be, do so. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important. &nbsp;You have a family.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And if they can&rsquo;t? &nbsp;And if I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo; she asked, genuinely unsure now whether or not she did.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,&rdquo; she smiled for a moment before the smile shifted to a look of concern. &nbsp;Either way, there are bigger things going on here than this. &nbsp;There is the small matter of the galactic war we have stumbled our way into the centre of here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn chuckled as she looked down and away. &nbsp;Patricia was right. &nbsp;Not a great time to be acting with the emotional maturity and impulse control of a teenager.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She stood. &nbsp;&ldquo;We good?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean&hellip; for now? &nbsp;Can we forget I did that until&hellip; later?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Presuming you can keep it in your pants,&rdquo; Patricia smirked and teased uncharacteristically, leaving Kathryn to sense a vast wilderness behind her eyes which she&rsquo;d only scratched the surface of.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn just smiled and shook her head as she moved to leave. &nbsp;Before summoning the door away she placed her fist on the wall and gently hit it a few times. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you Patricia.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn smiled at the thought of things to come as the door melted and she exited the room.</p>
