            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Two days later the New Horizon II put into orbit around the designated planet. &nbsp;The pilot was concerned about the amount of traffic, since none of them had ever seen orbital space so congested. &nbsp;Not only were there innumerable stations and vessels, but they were coming and going constantly from the planet as well. &nbsp; Fortunately when they were near enough to really begin worrying the planet transmitted a precise orbit for them to enter which would be clear of any other ship&rsquo;s activity. &nbsp;They fell in line a little less than two hundred kilometers behind another ship and could tell that there was another equidistant beyond that one, and they were lined up in a parallel parking orbit.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The ships they saw were not all regular shapes like the ones they&rsquo;d seen near the star. &nbsp; Certainly many were, but others had much more functional shapes. &nbsp;What appeared to be weapons platforms swarming all over the planet were hexagons a kilometer and a half wide and no less than a quarter kilometers deep. &nbsp; They were matte grey solids with no markings or irregularities to their shape. &nbsp;The sheer volume of them were what made them suspect a defence system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They even spotted some ships like Ralph&rsquo;s. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d explained that it was likely that in wartime any drone ships such as his which were near completion or recently completed would likely be repurposed for the war effort. &nbsp;He had to admit with some apparent embarrassment that he&rsquo;d never seen the objects they figured for weapons platforms, but he agreed it was a reasonable hypothesis as to their nature.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are&hellip; receiving landing coordinates,&rdquo; Jaren said with some amazement. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just like that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any other instructions?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Formal wear? &nbsp; Casually elegant maybe? &nbsp;Are we to bring a fruit basket? &nbsp;Bottle of Beashou nectar?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren chuckled. &nbsp; &ldquo;No, no&hellip; just coordinates.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you think Ralph? &nbsp;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is safe to assume that that is the location you are to go to if you wish to initiate formal diplomatic first contact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; Well I guess that&rsquo;s what we came all this way for. &nbsp;Well, somebody&rsquo;s got to stay behind in command of the ship. &nbsp;Jaren Felix had to stay last time, so I guess it&rsquo;s your turn to draw the short straw.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren seemed at once disappointed and relieved. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d already had far more adventure on this trip than he&rsquo;d bargained for, and he was happy to keep an eye on them from the ship and run support. &nbsp; He trusted his Kathryn, Felix, and Margaret to all look out for each other. &nbsp;Even more so he trusted his wife&rsquo;s ability to take care of herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She opened a comm channel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix, Margaret, meet me at Shuttle One, we&rsquo;re going down for formal greetings.&rdquo; &nbsp; She then turned to the robot who had been accompanying them on the bridge, standing on the floor as he was with his robot feet magnetised to the floor. &nbsp;&ldquo;How bout you Ralph? &nbsp;Feel like coming along? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if you even consider this in any way home or would be happy to see your builders again, but I have a feeling you&rsquo;ll be useful as an intermediary and translator. &nbsp;I know they&rsquo;ll technically be speaking English but you&rsquo;ve spent some time with us and I dare say we have a bit of a rapport at this point. &nbsp;Want to help out?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am willing yes. &nbsp;I have no particular urge to as I&rsquo;ve never been to this planet and never personally knew any builder, but it would be interesting to come along and I am happy to help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Reall? &nbsp; Happy? &nbsp;Is that even a thing for you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Figure of speech perhaps? &nbsp;Did I use it incorrectly?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She waved him off with an amused smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kat&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren paused as Kathryn unbuckled herself from her chair. &nbsp;&ldquo;The atmosphere&rsquo;s fine, but the gravity down there&hellip;&rdquo; he continued to poke at his terminal before swivelling his chair around. &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one point six two&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend spending more than a few days down there.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren I can think of any number of reasons I don&rsquo;t want to spend several days down there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man chuckled and agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right right&hellip; be safe. &nbsp;Get it done and hurry home. &nbsp;We have work to do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she&rsquo;d seen Margaret do a couple days ago she sarcastically saluted him but with a big enough smile that he knew she was just being playful. &nbsp;She was feeling encouraged. &nbsp;The aliens seemed happy to be making contact, and there seemed to be as good a chance as she could have hoped for in getting their help tracking down Maggie. &nbsp;Getting home again afterwards seemed like the far easier thing to obtain their cooperation with, but it was so remote a distant concern in her mind&rsquo;s hierarchy of concerns that she practically needed a telescope to see it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The four departed in the shuttle down to the surface. &nbsp;There was a landing pad at the exact coordinates they were provided, which was at the end of a walkway nearly a kilometer long leading to a massive crystalline structure. &nbsp;The surface of the path was purple, with indigo twisting spires lining it every dozen meters or so on both sides. &nbsp;At the end of the path was a structure which was hard to describe in Kathryn&rsquo;s own mind because she&rsquo;d never seen anything like it before. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It had the vague shape of an ancient castle with a generally rectangular central section roofed with innumerable smaller crystal spires. &nbsp;In the corners of the central sections were massive twisting spires like the ones lining the path but on a mammoth scale, easily a kilometer wide at the base and reaching into the sky over twice as high as the tallest point of the central structure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The color of it all was a deep emerald green, and when it came more clearly into view Kathryn heard Margaret whisper &lsquo;the Emerald City&hellip;&rdquo; to herself. &nbsp;She asked the simulated woman what she&rsquo;d meant, but she just waved her off and declined to explain.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they finally touched down on the purple surface of the landing pad, they could see a single solitary alien standing at the boundary between the path and the pad. &nbsp; It was clearly waiting for them on the wall interior video panels of the shuttle which allowed an unobstructed view all about them. &nbsp;A glint of light off of the sun caught Kathryn&rsquo;s eye which led her to notice the mirror ball drone accompanying the figure which had caused the flash on her eye.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After they touched down and the legs of the lander bent more than they ordinarily would to accommodate the extra weight in the heavier gravity well, the wall fell away and extended to produce a ramp for them to exit. &nbsp;&ldquo;Remember, best behaviour everyone,&rdquo; Kathryn said while looking directly at Margaret. &nbsp;The simulant nodded without saying a word which satisfied the captain.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She took a deep breath, plastered on a deep and confident smile, and walked down the ramp towards the alien.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; it said through the mirror ball as she approached. &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome to our planet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn thought to instinctively reach out to shake its hand but remembered that this was a cultural act it probably wouldn&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp;To her surprise, the creature extended its two jointed arm and offered its four fingered hand out to her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Proper names will be a stumbling block at first I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; it said. &nbsp;It then with its own voice made a noise so low and deep that it barely registered in Kathryn&rsquo;s ears. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is the name of this world in our language,&rdquo; it then said through the ball, &ldquo;and there is no appropriate translation in your language.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn thought, still quite overwhelmed by the enormity of the moment but keeping a professional head about her. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you call this planet?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Another similar tone just barely registering at the bottom of her hearing capacity. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I suggest you create your own words for these things. &nbsp;I assure you you will not offend.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How bout Bob?&rdquo; Margaret offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob what?&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn asked, turning around. &nbsp; &ldquo;For him?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, for the planet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We,&rdquo; she sighed. &nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t name the planet Bob.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That would make them the Bobbins wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Felix chimed in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I suppose it would,&rdquo; Margaret answered with pretend wonderment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bill of the Bobbins from Bob?&rdquo; Felix asked with feigned earnestness.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn just put a hand to her face and lowered her head while she shook it. &nbsp;She then looked up at them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever I say now that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to call them forever now isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The two just shrugged with big goofy smiles on their face. &nbsp;Kathryn sighed and turned back to the alien. &nbsp;It held out its hand again and said with a seriousness which made her almost laugh in its face: &ldquo;I am Bill, your special emissary to the Bobbins of Bob.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;With a tentativeness she couldn&rsquo;t completely suppress, she reached out to touch the alien hand. &nbsp;Its surface was surprisingly soothing to the touch. &nbsp;Their hands were very delicately furred, almost entirely orange in colour flowing from the highlights of orange which accentuated the otherwise deeply purple fur.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes fixated for a moment too long on the creature&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;Of the three round and bulging black eyes which crowned its head, two were facing her, but not directly. &nbsp;They were offset the way any typical prey animal back home would be to allow greater peripheral vision. &nbsp;She wondered what it must be like in its head, to always see a full three hundred and sixty degrees around it, for there to be no meaningful ahead and behind or to the side. &nbsp;Its mouth perhaps made it the most uncomfortable. &nbsp;It had two furry mandibles, each rooted on one side of its mouth and when not speaking resting all the way over to the other side of the mouth, the two thick projections seeming to serve as its lips, but with thick nasty looking talons at the end of each projection. &nbsp;That part in particular gave her a chill with the sense of a giant insect it engendered in her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Greetings&hellip; Bill. &nbsp;My name is Kathryn Janine Barnes of the United Fleet. &nbsp;This is my Chief Engineer Felix Ulysses Parker, and er, Specialist Margaret. &nbsp;Behind her is Ralph. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s a robot we implanted with the intelligence of the probe we encountered.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, we are aware,&rdquo; the mirror ball said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Very interesting what you did there. &nbsp;Since we made initial contact with the&hellip; Ralph unit, I have been tasked with learning everything I can about you, your language and culture, your mission, and what has happened so far.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sounds like a lot to study.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are&hellip; very quick learners, as you will see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; Bill said through his drone as it extended an arm down the long path to the emerald palace. &nbsp;Kathryn obliged and along with her crew followed the creature. &nbsp;&ldquo;I assume you have many questions, ask whatever you like.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to start.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You may take whatever time you need.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My&hellip; our most pressing concern is the location and whereabouts of my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, I can imagine.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know where she is?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sadly, no.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know why she was taken?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We suspect for the same reason Ralph was triggered with the imperative to bring you here. &nbsp;You represent a technological novelty, and samples were likely obtained for study towards a potential military advantage.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is she still alive.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The alien seemed to hesitate in responding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Unknown. &nbsp;It is possible, but not assured.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Will you help us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We wish to be friends with your people. &nbsp;We will assist you in whatever way we can which does not compromise the war effort.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Who is your enemy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our people knew peace for six thousand of your years. &nbsp;But then an ancient debate arose which divided us on ideological lines for the first time in living memory. &nbsp;There was disunity for the first time. &nbsp;The debate became hostile, and eventually violent.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What was the argument about?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My research suggests you are familiar with binary code, the bases of all fundamental computing?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The argument fundamentally rests on which comes first.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Which&hellip; what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Which integer, one or zero.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stopped dead in her tracks. &nbsp;The alien continued on for a small distance, then realized her halt and came back to her. &nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having a massive galactic civil war&hellip; over whether or not fundamental binary code starts with one or zero?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the mirror ball said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you not understand?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, no&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn uttered with depressed amazement. &nbsp;&ldquo;I fear and suspect that I understand all too well&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; it said as it resumed walking and the rest followed it. &nbsp;&ldquo;We naturally enough understand that zero comes first, as there must be the absence of something, for something to spring into existence within. &nbsp; Our enemy however believes that the absence of something without the pre-existence of something for reference in an impossibility. &nbsp;Quite silly, really.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Kathryn uttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp; She felt an additional weight on her chest beyond the additional gravity which was already weighing on her. &nbsp;It was easily contained for a woman such as herself, but a panic was niggling at the back of her mind that something so trivial could be the root of something so massive. &nbsp;&ldquo;How goes the war effort?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The conflict initially broke out over a hundred of your years ago, and the initial insurrection was put down quite easily. &nbsp;However, we were unaware that a small extremist faction had broken away and had been building a force in secret in a system with an uncharted portal system. &nbsp; When they re-emerged a few short years ago they had engaged in a tactic which was&hellip; terrifying to us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They hard wired The Link to be permanently active.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, the link?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No Captain, <em>my</em> apologies. &nbsp;I must explain. &nbsp;We Bobbins have a technology we refer to as &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;. &nbsp;It was first developed millions of years ago, but we long ago forgot how anyone could possibly function without it. &nbsp;It is a system which allows us to network our minds with each other the way you might network computers. &nbsp;When we are in The Link those within it think and function as a single mind, each mind contributing to the greater consciousness the way individual neurons contribute to a single mind.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One of the first things we learned about the link was the danger of leaving it permanently activated. &nbsp;Not only did it leave individuals vulnerable to overt manipulation, but individual life and experience was utterly lost. &nbsp;None wanted to exist solely as a member of The Link permanently, so the system was refined so that with a thought we can enter and exit The Link as we wish.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The Link is comfort, The Link is knowledge, The Link is power, but in The Link we are lost to ourselves, and so we only enter it deliberately and consciously. &nbsp; We can either access any information from it without entering it, or choose to surrender to its warm embrace.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The enemy however, took the radical step of hard wiring The Link so that every member of their faction is permanently in the link, and merely a drone within a hive mind. &nbsp;Not only is this terrifying sacrilege to us, but it is proving to make them a ruthless and cunning adversary. &nbsp;They act as a one, with a single intent and will, and that makes them very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We saw the ships at the portal, are you anticipating an attack?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;An attack is always possible,&rdquo; Bill answered plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This has been our home world since soon after we created The Link, and it is by far the most heavily fortified system in the galaxy, but there are only a few thousand Bobbins left in the system. &nbsp;All of the others have been evacuated to secret bases scattered throughout the galaxy in case of catastrophe here, and until we have turned the tide.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A few thousand,&rdquo; Felix balked. &nbsp;&ldquo;We saw over a thousand ships stationed just at the portal!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Those ships are largely automated and if necessary can operate completely independently. &nbsp; There are only between one and four crew on those vessels depending on the size. &nbsp;Of course there are hundreds of drone robots onboard to effect repairs and whatever other functions can be required as well. &nbsp;They are quite self-sufficient, much like the vessel Ralph was integrated into.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;By now they were nearing the crystal structure at the end of the path, and it was even more imposing standing right before it. &nbsp;The front wall seemed to reach all the way into the sky, and the spires straight up into space. &nbsp;Kathryn still couldn&rsquo;t quite tell if the material was glowing from within or absorbing and reemitting the light from the sun. &nbsp;Three major crystals immediately before them which reached to the top of the central structure began falling into the ground, and Kathryn marvelled at the lack of vibration or sound as they slid away to reveal an entrance to the facility.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our analysis suggests that we have a sixty three percent chance of success in the war, but it will be an incredibly destructive and ruinous victory if we are to have success at all. &nbsp;But we have a new hope,&rdquo; Bill said as the crystal shot up behind them again just as smoothly as they had descended.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; &nbsp; Was this the moment they decided to see how humans taste? &nbsp;The thought raced through the back of her mind and she chased it away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have reviewed your initial battle with Ralph. &nbsp;A species as technologically unsophisticated as yours should never have been able to disable a Bobbin drone ship, but you did.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah, with an antimatter warhead.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he said as he led them onto a circular platform marked with a ring in the centre of the large room they had entered as they passed through the front entrance. &nbsp;Once they were all standing on it, it began to rise out of the ground and lifting them up into the higher sections of the facility.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Forgive me, but using antimatter as a blunt instrument the way your missiles do is, well&hellip; simple. &nbsp;Simple in a way we haven&rsquo;t thought in millions of years. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been focusing all our efforts on creating better and better beam weapons of the sort which damaged your ship in the same encounter. &nbsp; What hit your ship was a fraction of one percent of the power output of the weapons on the larger warships you encountered when you entered the system.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You are so advanced you <em>forgot</em> about antimatter?&rdquo; Felix asked, amazed at the idea.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We never forgot about the concept of its existence, but the creating of it and potential uses are considered beyond antiquated. &nbsp;Certainly we can relearn quite quickly, but it will not be immediate. &nbsp; Though it will not be immediate, it will take some time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And the clock is ticking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Margaret asked. &nbsp;They were passing through level after level of what seemed to be an abandoned crystal castle. &nbsp;Bill wasn&rsquo;t kidding that the place had largely been evacuated. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because the enemy has our computer core, and no doubt studied the same battle and came to the same conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Kathryn muttered despite herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Bill agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;But we have something they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You. &nbsp; Your ship. &nbsp;Your already existent weapons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, <em>we</em> do,&rdquo; Kathryn corrected him with concern.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s mirror ball assured her with a hint of dismissiveness.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The platform they were standing approached the top of the building, and as they approached the ceiling phased away the same way she had seen the alien vessel airlock do on New Horizon II. &nbsp;The platform then took its place as the ground on what seemed to be the roof of the structure. &nbsp;The spires still scraped the sky above them, but all about them was an immense and immaculately manicured alien garden with a seemingly infinite number of plants which she couldn&rsquo;t identify in the slightest. &nbsp;Some had a vague similarity in appearance to plants she was familiar with back home, but all betrayed their alien origin.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain, this building is the centre of everything. &nbsp;The Link, as well as all of our governance, bureaucracy, science, and culture rotates about the axis of this building. &nbsp;It is the capital of our capital. &nbsp;In this garden are the most beautiful botanical samples from ten billion worlds. &nbsp;Our galactic population nears a hundred trillion and before this war reared its ugly head we were thriving. &nbsp;This building would ordinarily be bustling with excited activity and any number of people would be wanting to meet you and learn from you for any number of reason.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We cherish first contact Captain. &nbsp;Ordinarily you would be overwhelmed with the regalia of our greeting. &nbsp;If you wish, we can gather up those who can spare the time and still hold a monumental feast and welcoming ceremony. &nbsp;The alternative, is we skip all that for now, and start working on a plan to work together in defeating our enemy and getting your daughter back if possible, before the enemy learns how to utterly devastate us. &nbsp; We can show and teach you wonders beyond your imagination, we could be better friends to your people than you could possibly imagine, but not if we are defeated by our enemy by technology you have introduced to the equation.&rdquo;</p>
