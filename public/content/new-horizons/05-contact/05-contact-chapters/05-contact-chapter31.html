            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn hugged Maggie so tight that she had trouble breathing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ow, Mom,&rdquo; she struggled to get out, &ldquo;I know, I miss you too but you&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, oh I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Kathryn muttered as she pulled away but kept hands on her shoulders, unable to break contact. &nbsp;She was crying just enough for small tears to breach the welling up in her eyes, but it was more than she&rsquo;d ever let Maggie see. &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought, I was worried that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know Mom, I know,&rdquo; Maggie said as she took one of her mother&rsquo;s hands into both of hers. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo; she offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We all are, see?&rdquo; she removed a hand to gesture towards Felix who had brought Maggie to meet them a the airlock on Orbital One. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; have they told you about Kobol?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her daughter only got a confused look on her face.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix spoke up. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;d only just found out before we heard you were on your way,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think it was our place to tell her. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry if that was the wrong thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;For the moment Kathryn ignored what she may or may not have felt about it. &nbsp;She held both of Maggie&rsquo;s hands and looked down for a moment to compose herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh god, he&rsquo;s not dead is he!??&rdquo; Maggie exclaimed with violent despair as she added things up to one possible explanation for everyone&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kathryn looked up to say. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh god Sweetie no, no nothing like that, I&rsquo;m sorry to make you think that. &nbsp;Your father himself is fine but,&rdquo; she took a moment to reflect to herself how fundamentally not okay he was when she last saw him, but it didn&rsquo;t matter right now. &nbsp;&ldquo;But his people, Kobol&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn swallowed. &nbsp;Maggie had spent a lot of time on Kobol, she had relatives, friends. &nbsp;She was to be a bridesmaid for her half sister there in a few months, they&rsquo;d picked out a dress already. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kobol was attacked by the enemy Bobbins, the ones who attacked you. &nbsp;They&hellip; it was completely destroyed. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know yet if there are any survivors. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve sent a relief mission but early reports are-&rdquo; she because aware of how little more information mattered or could help by the expression on Maggie&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Maggie, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn tried to pull her into a hug but was held at arm&rsquo;s length by a firm hand on her chest. &nbsp;Her expression was one of numb disbelief, her eyes searching for answers that didn&rsquo;t exist, a way it could not be true or made to make sense, but there was no sense to make of it. &nbsp;Not the kind she was looking for anyways. &nbsp;Kathryn remembered that her response was alloyed with her own experiences at the hands of the enemy and just wished she&rsquo;d let her hug her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want to help in the relief efforts.&rdquo; she finally said with a tone that made it clear she didn&rsquo;t consider the matter up for debate.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked down searching for a way to satisfy her understandable instinct to help as well as the wish to keep her safe. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying no. &nbsp;I understand.&rdquo; &nbsp;She gently removed Maggie&rsquo;s hand from her chest and held it in both hands as she lowered it. &nbsp;&ldquo;The first responders are already underway though, and we still don&rsquo;t know exactly what they&rsquo;re going to find out there. &nbsp;After they&rsquo;ve conducted an initial survey and have a clearer idea of the kind of help they&rsquo;re going to need there&rsquo;ll be a way you can help, okay?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie&rsquo;s anger was beginning to seep through the cracks of her despondent shock and Kathryn was reminded how very much her daughter she was. &nbsp;The urgency of now always taking point, the realities of what she faced roiling underneath.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Not letting go of her daughter with her right arm and hand, she pulled Felix into a hug with her left and rested her head on his as she hugged him hard with one arm. &nbsp;&ldquo;How you holding up?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he answered somewhat distantly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pissed off and eager to punch back though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Amen brother, Amen.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;When will I see Daddy again?&rdquo; Maggie asked. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t been reduced to calling him that for several years and Kathryn found it both heartwarming and incredibly sad.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know Sweetie, I&rsquo;m sorry. &nbsp;As you can imagine he&rsquo;s&hellip; upset. &nbsp;We left him in the Koboli system to listen for any distress signals or otherwise while we checked the other systems. &nbsp;We feared the worst, that-&rdquo; &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t sure how much it was fair to burden her with. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know if the other systems had been attacked and our priority was to find out and in a worst-case scenario figure out who was left and who needed our help the most.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie nodded thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;But we sent the first relief vessels through right away and I&rsquo;m certain he would have insisted on joining them for the first close survey of the planet, but I&rsquo;m safe. &nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you record a message for him, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been told you&rsquo;re okay but he&rsquo;d definitely appreciate hearing from you and answer. &nbsp;When you go with the second relief wave you&rsquo;ll be able to see him.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn noticed Margaret standing in the airlock behind her, being uncharacteristically waiting patiently for the human drama to adequately resolve itself. &nbsp;Ralph seemed to be hiding behind her and a black Bobbin eye on it stalk was peering around the corner at them. &nbsp;She looked at her daughter and sighed with the weight of a galaxy on her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Maggie but I need to get back to work now. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot going on. &nbsp;Things moving quickly and your mother&rsquo;s right in the middle of it. &nbsp;Forgive me?&rdquo; &nbsp;&lt;retcon&gt;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Go get &lsquo;em,&rdquo; she said, looking up at her with big eyes. &nbsp;&quot;I&rsquo;m gonna go get ready for when I can leave to help on Kobol.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded with an understanding smile before turning and trading her Mom hat for her Admiral cap. &nbsp;She looked around for the highest ranking officer in the room. &nbsp;She found a lieutenant commander and motioned him towards her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need two things,&rdquo; she explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to get every senior Star Fleet officer and civilian government official into the general assembly room and I need a secure path from this room to the assembly. &nbsp; Station heavy arms guard at every access point. &nbsp;Not a soul is to see us or our guest on our way there, do I make myself absolutely clear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She saw the man look past her for a moment towards the weird looking robot and tentacled eye hiding behind Margaret at the airlock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; he stiffened and answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not a soul, aye. &nbsp;They are already waiting for you in the assembly room though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you Commander.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned to the airlock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s get on with it then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn, Felix, Margaret, Ralph, and Bob all stood behind the partitions behind the stage of the general assembly room which was modeled after the old UN general assembly room in New York and back when the station was in use by its original builders, would sometime function as an alternate meeting space as the prestige of the old United States declined and nobody could agree on another nation to host it in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Before she could go on stage to introduce Bob and explain the situation more fully than in her reports, she received a transmission on her scroll marked with the highest personal priority, a permission she only granted to Jaren, Maggie, Felix, Margaret, and her immediate superior in her chain of command. &nbsp;It allowed them to send such a message which would insistently sound a tone even when she&rsquo;d set the device to silent. &nbsp;It was Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The message was also marked &lsquo;Private&rsquo; and &lsquo;Top Secret&rsquo;, and carried the heaviest encryption available to them. &nbsp;She excused herself to the far corner of the waiting area behind the stage, and popping on her PANEs she started the message playback after entering her security code and allowing the scroll to run all of the biometric scans it was able to.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kathryn,&rdquo; he started, looking a bit more human than the last time she saw him. &nbsp;His uncharacteristic cold distance had given way a more genuine jumble of anger and grief, but now seemingly some degree of acceptance and resolve.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am relieved that the other colony systems are largely untouched.&rdquo; &nbsp;She was grateful that despite his loss he was able to express this sentiment; it meant he was beginning to come back from whatever dark place he&rsquo;d been pushed to. &nbsp;He sighed with a depth that made her own heart sink before continuing. &nbsp;&ldquo;But Kobol is&hellip;&rdquo; he looked away for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing left. &nbsp;No survivors.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She paused the playback for a moment to absorb the blow. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d known this was a possibility, likely even, but she&rsquo;d still held out hope that it could be any other way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made contact with a few stragglers who were on ships throughout the system and were able to keep their head down enough to avoid attack. &nbsp;They were all older ships with no anti-matter aboard and that&rsquo;s probably what saved them.&rdquo; &nbsp;Made sense, she figured. &nbsp;She was still waiting for what he had to say that required the high level of security attached to the message.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He looked down and away from the camera and she sensed a note of shame in his expression, but it was hard to tell because she couldn&rsquo;t remember another time she&rsquo;d ever known him to be ashamed of anything. &ldquo;You were right about my people,&rdquo; he offered, &ldquo;&hellip;about me.&rdquo; he added. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t trust you, the other colonies. &nbsp;Distrust of others was baked into our civilization from the beginning. &nbsp;We valued the alliance, but couldn&rsquo;t let ourselves lose the upper hand in it, couldn&rsquo;t risk any possibility of aggression no matter how reliable you became as allies, no matter how closely we worked together.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Get to the point Jaren,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get to the fucking point Jaren, what are you trying to say?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We built up a strategic reserve of anti-matter weapons in secret and hid them in such a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to detect them.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s face dropped in disbelief at the scale of his lies to her, the depths of his and his people&rsquo;s distrust and xenophobia that she&rsquo;d never understood until coming to full clarity now. &nbsp;She had to push back the hope hard that he was going to say next what she desperately needed him to, but why else bring it up?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know how this must sound to you, what it must say to you about Kobol, about me&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;The look of shame again, deeper this time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Get to the fucking point Jaren!!</em>&rdquo; she angrily whispered too loudly to remain a whisper and she saw the others look over at her with concern.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He sighed heavily, then came out with it. &nbsp;&ldquo;I dispatched one of the relief ships to check after it became clear there was nothing they could do on Kobol. &nbsp;The measures we took to conceal it from you must have worked on them too, because it&rsquo;s still there. &nbsp;All of it. &nbsp;Tonnes of anti-matter, thousands of warheads ready to fire. &nbsp;I wanted to keep Kobol out of the fighting. &nbsp;I knew we&rsquo;d become their primary target and wanted to keep us safe. &nbsp;But now I just want to do everything I can to help kill as many of them as I can and defend what we have left.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I guess you were right,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pacifism is for fools,&rdquo; he sated bitterly before ending the message. &nbsp;After his face left the screen it was replaced by a map of the Koboli system marking one of the moons of the outermost gas giant as the location of the stockpile with the text &lsquo;Haun&rsquo;s Mill&rsquo;.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Only past a certain point,&rdquo; Kathryn mourned as she pushed the scroll closed and started into space away from the others. &nbsp;The brightness of the screen left her blind in the relative darkness while her eyes adjusted. &nbsp;Her mind couldn&rsquo;t decide if it wanted to be more angry at the Koboli for keeping something like this secret, dismayed at yet another nail in the coffin of her marriage, or elation at what it meant for the war effort.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she walked back over to the others, she reopened the scroll and accessed the message again. &nbsp;She pressed it to Felix&rsquo;s chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;You should all see this,&rdquo; she said before leaving them to enter out to the stage without saying another word.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The cacophony of angry, panicked shouting became more pronounced with nothing between her and the assembled crowd and she tapped on the microphone until they all quieted down and looked up at her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I expect everyone in this room knows who I am and has read my preliminary report. &nbsp;There is now more to add and clarify, and afterwards I&rsquo;ll answer whatever questions I can.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;First though, it is my sad duty to inform you that I have received a communique from Jaren Snow in the Koboli system. &nbsp;A detailed search has shown that while there are a handful of survivors scattered about the system, Koboli itself has been completely destroyed with no apparent survivors.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The crowd exploded with raucous, frantic panic and she let them feel the weight of the news for a few moments before tapping at the microphone again to bring their attention back to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;So my particular sympathies to the Koboli in the room.&rdquo; &nbsp;She heard what she&rsquo;d come to recognize as a Bobbin squeal of excitement off stage, presumably in response to Bob hearing Jaren report the stockpile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I implore Star Fleet and civilian leaderships of the other worlds to do anything, commit any resource to assist you however we can, to safeguard and care for all survivors and to preserve what we can of your people&rsquo;s culture. &nbsp;You are among friend,&rdquo; she said, before clarifying: &ldquo;among family.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And as you learned from my report, while we have new enemies, we also have new friends whom we might come to call family as well, if extended family. &nbsp;Come on out her Bob.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stood beside the podium on the side Bob entered from and held his hand, standing side by side with him to demonstrate her newfound friendship with the strange creature. &nbsp;His black eyes darted about on their stalks as the crowd erupted again, this time half in anger, half in denouncement of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And because the Koboli are our family, we must understand and forgive what I have just learned from Jaren, something which I&rsquo;m sure every high ranking Koboli in this room is likely privy to and unsure if they should share. &nbsp;So let me help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She sighed. &nbsp;As hard as it was to accept, it was even harder to break it to her own people. &nbsp;The upper leadership were pragmatists and appropriately more skeptical of the Koboli and their motives, but on the whole the Roma and Havenites believed in their coalition, believed they were making genuine strides towards trust and interoperation. &nbsp;Star Fleet itself, along with the intergovernmental coordination in exploring Earth and bringing the station they stood on back to life were all symbols of that hope. &nbsp;Now she had to shatter some of that illusion, but it also didn&rsquo;t seem to matter much anymore given what happened to Kobol.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The Koboli kept a secret stockpile of anti-matter weapons. &nbsp;They built and hid enough to easily win a multi front war if we ever joined forces against them.&rdquo; &nbsp;She leaned in a little closer to the microphone as a cacophony began to rise in the crowd at the news. &nbsp;&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s still there,&rdquo; she stated with force. &nbsp;&ldquo;They missed it,&rdquo; she added with a smirk. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all still there, thousands of warheads ready to fire, warheads the enemy ships are completely defenseless against, &lsquo;<em>if</em>&rsquo; integrated into Bobbin weapons systems.&rdquo; &nbsp;The crowd grew louder, but the shock and anger at the Koboli subterfuge was gradually giving way to patriotic zeal. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn got closer to the microphone and spoke louder to be sure to be heard over the noise. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank to the Koboli we have the means to take the fight to the enemy, to strike back in their name. &nbsp;Because of them we have a chance to save the rest of us from their fate but we have to work together, dare to trust our new allies!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The crowd was growing to raucous jingoistic fervor. &nbsp;The sense of growing bloodlust made something in Kathryn deeply uncomfortable, but she knew the stakes. &nbsp;She knew they had stumbled into a conflict which galactic prosperity in victory, and certain extinction of the human race in defeat.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Pacifism had its limits.</p>
