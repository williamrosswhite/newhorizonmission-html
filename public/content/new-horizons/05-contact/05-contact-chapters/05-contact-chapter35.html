            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After a couple minutes the door slid open and she fell back into the bridge and hit her head.&nbsp; She could feel the eyes of everyone on the bridge but she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to look away from the ceiling to see.&nbsp; Someone stepped over her and she felt them grab a handful of her uniform at her chest and roughly haul her torso upright.&nbsp; As the door slid closed behind her again, in her catatonia her eyes were brought level to see Jaren&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; His express was one she couldn&rsquo;t quite put his finger on despite the decade and a half she&rsquo;d been intimate with him.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her head fell back against the door as she puzzled at his face.&nbsp; The had grown so distant from each other in recent weeks that she had no idea if he was going to hug her or hit her, and at the moment she didn&rsquo;t really care.&nbsp; She felt a nothingness she&rsquo;d never not felt before.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He slumped down beside her and put his arm around her, pulling her head against his chest and she let him.&nbsp; It was somatically comforting at least, still a body she recognized as comfort, as safety after all these years.&nbsp; In some deep senses they were still them.&nbsp; She wondered how long it would feel that way, what the half life was on love for the father of her child, for the man she&rsquo;d built a life with, a family.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now you know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She looked up at him to see him shift his gaze from a look out the window, deep into a distant part of the galaxy down into her eyes to meet her gaze.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This is how I&rsquo;ve felt since Kobol,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; She nodded briefly before burying her face into his armpit like she was a child, like she&rsquo;d seen Margaret do countless times as she&rsquo;d grown up.&nbsp; He was a good father, and for the first time she acknowledged and appreciated how much that meant to her not having had one of her own, how soothing it had been over the years to be around a presence like that.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What the hell do I do now?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren just nodded for a time as he looked back out into eternity.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Anything you can do won&rsquo;t be enough, and you can&rsquo;t do anything you really want to.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned back to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll never get over.&nbsp; None of us were ready for this.&nbsp; Despite all our training, bravado, and pretense to playing soldier, every one of us was a green cadet fresh out of the academy.&nbsp; Every single one of us, you included.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t fair for you to be in this position any more than it was for any of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s pause he added: &ldquo;Calm seas make unexperienced sailors.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that he rose to his feet after pushing at her enough to prompt her to hold herself up under her own power.&nbsp; He held his hand out to help her get up, his head framed by one of the ceiling lights creating a halo around his head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I lost my world.&nbsp; You lost your fleet.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go do something about it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Part of her wanted to be angry at him, another part wanted to just turn back to the deck plating and sob, let someone else carry the burden of history which had broken her.&nbsp; But another part heard again what Sato had said to her.&nbsp; If not her it could only be somebody worse.&nbsp; Not exactly the spirit of the message Sato left her for a moment like this, but it was close enough to get the job done.&nbsp; Summoning what strength she could, she rose to her feet, avoiding using the wall as support to root herself in her own strength again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The people out there may not have the same weight on them as you do, but they&rsquo;re just as scared.&nbsp; They feel abandoned by their leader in their darkest moment.&nbsp; You need to stow all of it and get out there and do your job,&rdquo; he demanded with his fierce, piercing blue eyes.&nbsp; He seemed to be pushing her now that she was regaining strength, pushing to prompt her to strengthen up further in resistance.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d always made a good team&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But first fix your face,&rdquo; he said as he pulled some tissues out one of his coveralls&rsquo; pockets.&nbsp; She laughed a blunted embarrassed laugh for a moment as she dabbed at her eyes and nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then suck it up princess, we&rsquo;re not at the academy anymore.&rdquo; he said with a weird expression that made her frown and shake her head at him with a good-natured tinge that made it clear the words were received as intended.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She breathed in slowly and as deeply as she could through her nose before blowing it out as slowly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Report!&rdquo; she barked as she stormed back onto the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s in good shape Admiral,&rdquo; Brinkerhoff answered as he rose out of his seat at her entrance.&nbsp; He assumed the traditional at ease stance, his feet shoulder width apart and his hands clasped behind his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was part of why the battle went the way it did; we&rsquo;ve been studying telemetry from the data.&nbsp; As long as our ships had shadow matter to repel the enemy beam weapons, the rest of the ships were generally unharmed.&nbsp; Once depleted it only took one shot of any strength to destroy them.&nbsp; Replenishing our shadow matter that way was a good thought, saved our butts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn approached the command chairs in the middle of the bridge, and Brinkerhoff respectfully stepped away from the centre chair.&nbsp; She was please it wasn&rsquo;t going to be a fight.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d been the fleet admiral, and now that their fleet was reduced to one it was her prerogative to assume personal command of the remaining ship.&nbsp; He could easily have resisted given her minor nervous breakdown but he seemed to have no inclination.&nbsp; She held her hand out to the XO&rsquo;s seat not just in invitation for him to make himself more comfortable, but more symbolically asking him to accept the position of her first officer having assumed command of the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He seemed to hesitate for a moment and Kathryn was unclear if he had second thoughts about relinquishing command to her, or if maybe his pride caught in his throat being an admiral serving as first officer.&nbsp; She recognized the expression he shifted to as he decided to take the seat, it was one she&rsquo;d seen in the mirror before reentering the bridge.&nbsp; None of that shit mattered anymore.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Weapons?&rdquo; she asked once he&rsquo;d sat.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Four remaining anti-matter warheads Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Survivors?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He paused for too long.&nbsp; &ldquo;None.&rdquo;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been scanning, but the ships were all carrying anti-matter.&nbsp; When containment was breached, the rest of the ships were annihilated.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re seeing very little debris out there just a lot of ambient high energy radiation bouncing around.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not entirely correct,&rdquo; Bob offered from behind them, prompting them to swivel their chairs around towards him.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are a number of Bobbin emergency shells out there, thin bubbles of shadow matter with survivors in them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; that&rsquo;s good to hear Bob,&rdquo; she managed to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they require our assistance?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are slowly making their way towards the crystal on maneuvering thrusters and should make their way there less than an hour.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to send reports to our command along with them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem,&rdquo; his mirror ball said in an even tone, and she appreciated more fully than she had how devastated he must be as well.&nbsp; She offered him a nod which intended to convey her condolences and her intention to commiserate with him when they had the opportunity.&nbsp; He seemed to understand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is there enough shadow matter out there to reconfigure any new warships?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;By volume yes,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; But the enemy knew where to target us.&nbsp; Some discrete components we can&rsquo;t generate with shadow matter, specifically the components which control it.&nbsp; Without them it&rsquo;s like trying to (something more relatable in this context than) pulling yourself up by your own boot straps.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does that mean there&rsquo;s a lot of shadow matter lying around we could use to replenish our reserves in the same way as before?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Got an idea?&rdquo; Brinkerhoff asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re already topped up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I might.&nbsp; Have we had a chance to see what forces are left at the target?&rdquo; she asked as Felix and Margaret entered the bridge with Ralph close behind.&nbsp; She considered it a good sign that the chief engineer didn&rsquo;t need to be somewhere else still so soon after the battle.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We can see it on our primary telescope,&rdquo; Lieutenant Tarsus answered as he brought it up to the main display.&nbsp; A world covered in a swirling blanket of yellow and brown clouds filled the monitor.&nbsp; Over a few seconds targets began appear on the display marking half a dozen ships slowly moving across and around it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I recognize that deployment configuration,&rdquo; Bob said.&nbsp; He came around to the centre of the bridge and stood beside the empty second officer&rsquo;s chair to her left which was incompatible with the configuration of his body.&nbsp; There are as many on the far side we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Seeing the markings indicate one dodecahedron, three octahedrons, and two cubes, she asked him: &ldquo;Same classes of ships?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Impossible to say,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a standard spatial deployment.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t give any indication of the kinds of ships.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Kathryn said, sighing more on the inside than outside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lieutenant Tarsus, pin that display.&nbsp; Put a tally of ships and their types to the side and keep updating it as new ships come into view.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aye, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn noticed she was chewing her thumb and she forced it down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lieutenant Byrne, plot a course.&nbsp; Best possible speed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s head snapped to face her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Problem?&rdquo; she asked, then watched him consider for a few moments whether or not he was going to have one.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; he answered finally.&nbsp; &ldquo;Actually today feels like a great day for a suicide run.&rdquo; he added grimly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Attaboy,&rdquo; she said, patting him on the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s see what we can do to even the odds first.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Brinkerhoff seemed let out a slow exhale as discretely as he could at the understanding that an outright suicide run wasn&rsquo;t what she had in mind, and she appreciated the man&rsquo;s resolve, his willingness to follow her to the gates of hell.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d made a good XO.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned back to her other side.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong Bob.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tilted his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;We still have one shadow matter control interface left.&rdquo;&nbsp; It took him a moment, but after a few beats his eye stalks went extra straight and rigid.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d learned this to be their equivalent of wide-eyed excitement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re getting at,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me twenty minutes to see what I can work up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded and he excitedly scurried away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Mr. Brinkerhoff I want us ready for operations in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stood and headed for her ready room, giving a come hither hand gesture to Jaren and the others who&rsquo;d joined them on the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Once inside and the door had closed, Felix started to say: &ldquo;Kathryn oh my god I&rsquo;m so sor-&rdquo; but she held up her hand to cut him off.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time for that shit.&rdquo; she coldly interjected with a raised hand.&nbsp; He backed down but could tell he was hurt.&nbsp; She put a hand on his shoulder to take a moment to reassure him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we will later,&rdquo; she offered more softly.&nbsp; He put his hand up and put it on hers for a moment with a sombre nod before looking up with more resolve and Kathryn withdrew her hand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob is working on an idea which may give us a chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a few moment&rsquo;s thought she added: &ldquo;If a small one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; Felix said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe I can help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of stray shadow matter out there but it can&rsquo;t configure into any new ships because the enemy deliberately targeted all of our Bobbin&rsquo;s control systems for it.&nbsp; Without it the material can&rsquo;t be shaped.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure what he&rsquo;ll come up with, but I prompted him to consider that we still have ours.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But our reserves are already replenished,&rdquo; the image of a face on Ralph&rsquo;s face said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Considering him more deliberately than she had in a while, she looked at him with an expression which suggested the urge to have him as a meal had struck up in her.&nbsp; Before they had the opportunity to find out if he could be made uncomfortable by such a thing, the door slid open and Bob entered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay, here&rsquo;s what I got-&ldquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she interrupted him.&nbsp; He seemed annoyed at being interrupted as he was launching into his info dump, but he stopped short anyway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh Bob&hellip; is there any way you could rig up our friend here as a shadow matter control system?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The resulting flash of annoyed frustration on its mirror ball gave way to a colour unmistakably indicative of the same expression she&rsquo;d had when sizing him up.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into it,&rdquo; he offered mischievously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyways, I have an idea but it will require scooping up every stray bit of shadow matter we can from the debris left from the battle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve already rigged the system to store the material in growing sacs off to the side of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn reached behind her to press a comm button on her desk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, we need to collect all available shadow matter out there.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pressed another button to mute so Byrne would know she wasn&rsquo;t finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean like, every molecule of it Bob.&nbsp; Down to what scale?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say&hellip; every blob down to oh&hellip; half a meter across.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kathryn nodded but as she reached for the unmute button she saw him size up Ralph again and the correct himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make that forty,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Margaret lightly tapped his central mass to get his attention and his stalks stiffened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I meant thirty-five.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn unmuted the comms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Correction Lieutenant.&nbsp; We need to collect every blob down to thirty-five centimeters wide, so don&rsquo;t worry about getting the biggest blobs first, just access Bob&rsquo;s analysis and plot a course to pick up every bit we need.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll take some time Admiral,&rdquo; she heard him answer back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask Lieutenant, just get it done best possible speed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn closed the channel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My&hellip; well, I guess the closest thing you might call it would be my graduate thesis, was working on trying to figure out how to configure a ship larger than an icosahedron.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We wondered why you stopped there,&rdquo; Felix said, &ldquo;why only perfect congruent regular polygons.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complexity issue,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Using ships designed exclusively out of shadow matter, we haven&rsquo;t found a way to keep them stable otherwise, at least for larger ships.&nbsp; My thesis was exploring how we could overcome this limitation, and one way was to have a base physical ship to project the geometry in a more stable way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A ship like ours,&rdquo; Felix offered, seeming to start to understand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Bob affirmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are varied enough surface geometries to this ship for something more exotic to project away from.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t finished my simulations, but I&rsquo;m confident we can work something up.&nbsp; Something those #$_@(#)#* won&rsquo;t )#*)(#_@@ see coming.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had never seen Bob try to curse before, its mirror ball seemed unwilling or unable to faithfully translate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well get to it then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gather the Bobbins onboard and we&rsquo;ll develop a workable model,&rdquo; it acknowledged.&nbsp; It then looked back over at Ralph and Margaret.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure out something for you as well,&rdquo; it added, with something its mirror ball suggested of a mischievous grin.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Records messages for leadership back home, then Sato, and then Maggie.&nbsp; When she starts to record for Maggie she thinks better of it, and invites Jaren to record one with her and they do so together.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aaand&hellip; that&rsquo;s the last of it,&rdquo; Byrne informed with satisfaction as the last of the required shadow matter blobbed onto the enormous sphere of material that now surrounded them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d had to gather so much that they were engulphed in a doughnut shaped mass of the material over a kilometer and a half wide with their engines sticking out one side of the doughnut hole and the their forward instruments out the front.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright Bob, you&rsquo;re up.&rdquo;</p>
