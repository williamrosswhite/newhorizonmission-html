            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After Bob told her that they were approximately 12 hours away from completing all necessary modifications and refits, Admiral Barnes ordered rest for everyone who would be taking part in the assault. &nbsp;It required some rotation and clever human resource management, but they maximized the amount of rest which could be had while planning for departure as soon as they were ready. &nbsp;Following her own orders, Kathryn returned to the commander&rsquo;s quarters on Orbital One and collapsed onto the couch in exhaustion. &nbsp;Like everyone else she hadn&rsquo;t gotten much rest in the last seventy-two hours. &nbsp;The little time they gave the enemy to prepare, adapt, and anticipate, the better their odds but pushing past the human limiting need for sleep was rapidly having diminishing returns, and she kept having to push away the thought the disaster on the station was her fault for pushing everyone too hard.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Focusing so explicitly on everything she could and needed to do to keep her safe, Kathryn hadn&rsquo;t really thought about her daughter much in the last few days. &nbsp;When she looked back and saw the worried expression on Maggie&rsquo;s face from the doorway to her bedroom, Kathryn motioned her over. &nbsp;She noticed with bittersweet understanding that she was clinging to her stuffed elephant Pookie who still lived on her bed but hadn&rsquo;t been clung to for comfort like that for years. &nbsp;It reminded Kathryn that for how brave a front she put up, for how grown up she struggled to present herself, she was still a child. &nbsp;Today she couldn&rsquo;t be anything other than a scared little girl who had yet to even begin to process and work through the horrible trauma she&rsquo;d been subjected to only a few days earlier.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How you holding up, Kiddo?&rdquo; she asked as the girl sat beside her and curled up into her, practically in fetal position. &nbsp;It was another outward expression of vulnerability she hadn&rsquo;t seen from her in years. &nbsp;Despite all the horrible shit that contributed to it, if it could all be ignored it was nice to have her little girl back for a moment or two. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She was happy to see her little girl take her first steps towards independent womanhood, done everything she could to encourage it, but it was nice that in a moment like this, stressed by recent trauma, they could both regress to something more comforting. &nbsp;It was reassuring that this was still there underneath, that she&rsquo;d done a good job of making her feel secure enough to grow out into the world and into the person she was to be, knowing that she had this at her back, that there was a sense of home and safety in vulnerability she could always return to when she got knocked back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she stroked her hair, noticing that she wasn&rsquo;t crying but instead just seemed a kind of numb, Kathryn reflected on her own childhood, on never having this for herself. &nbsp;Her parents took care of her. &nbsp;They did their duty. &nbsp;She never went hungry. &nbsp;She was appropriately praised for her successes and appropriately admonished for her failures and missteps. &nbsp;But she&rsquo;d always felt lonely. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As a precocious child she&rsquo;d always had trouble relating to other kids, always off in her own world thinking about other bigger things. &nbsp;She remembered lying on the grass in their backyard at night watching the artificial star of the sun reflecting off of the original New Horizon&rsquo;s hull trace its path across the sky, and then waiting an hour and a half for it to pass by again and then doing it all over again. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She&rsquo;d been just entering university when Haven started experimenting with rocketry. &nbsp;A decade later as a fleet Commander she was the first to go back to the old ship but that journey started there in the backyard as a little girl, watching it for hours and dreaming about what was then only science fiction. &nbsp;As proud of she was for where her passion had taken her, it was always tinged by sadness at what she was running away from, at what she was searching for that she never had at home. &nbsp;Her parents ably took care of her, but she never felt like she&rsquo;d ever developed any kind of relationship with them. &nbsp;They were always alien to her somehow, things she didn&rsquo;t understand about them, things they didn&rsquo;t understand about her any better than her peers at school.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She&rsquo;d developed a couple close friendships with people like Felix, had some bad relationships where she replicated the same alienation she felt around her parents, but it wasn&rsquo;t until she met Jaren that she felt that real spark of a kindred spirit, of being seen and understood by someone she recognized the same way. &nbsp;He had passion for understanding and exploration, for pushing frontiers as much as his repressive culture permitted. &nbsp;He came from wealth and privilege, but it never seemed to mean much to him and she came to understand that was the alienation he felt, the feeling they shared, which resonated, but was rooted in different things.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she thought about how pleased she was to have successfully fostered that kind of deeper relationship with Maggie that she&rsquo;d been starved for with her own parents as a child and reflected on how grateful she was at Jaren&rsquo;s similar interest in nurturing the same thing in her, she noticed Patricia in the doorway to Maggie&rsquo;s room and was surprised that Maggie would behave this vulnerably in front of anyone else. &nbsp;It made her realize how much time they&rsquo;d spent together and how comfortable Maggie must have become around her as a result.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maybe they&rsquo;d pushed her too far in that direction, she flashed a moment of concern. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d heard about people pushing their children to the inverse extreme of their own issues, overcorrecting. &nbsp;Maybe they&rsquo;d made her too emotional, too ready to make herself vulnerable before others, too easily hurt&hellip; something she&rsquo;d have to consciously reassess if she survived the next few days.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia gestured towards an adjacent chair with an expression which asked if it was okay for her to join them and Kathryn subtly nodded and tilted her head to the side as she continued to slowly stroke Maggie&rsquo;s hair. &nbsp;She realized it had been a few minutes and Maggie had never answered her original question. &nbsp;She moved her hand from her hair to placed it on her back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You okay Mags? &nbsp;I mean,&rdquo; she scoffed as Patricia held the bottom of her flower print dress to her legs as she sat down to avoid it bunching up, then carefully smoothed it out after sitting. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean obviously nothing is okay right now Sweetie, but&hellip; you managing? &nbsp;Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking about what comes next,&rdquo; she admitted. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; worried.&rdquo; &nbsp;The girl sat up to speak more directly to her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming you and Dad are both going to participate in whatever operation you&rsquo;re planning. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen what they can do, what they&rsquo;re capable of. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m scared for both of you. &nbsp;For everyone. &nbsp;And what happened to the station&hellip; they&rsquo;re saying it might not be salvageable, that we might have to evacuate if they can&rsquo;t get the damage under control.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded. &nbsp;It had been less than two hours since the explosion rocked the station and she thought about how much more dramatic it must have been for her having been on the station itself and not knowing right away what had happened.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I thought&hellip;&rdquo; the girl started tearing up. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought they&rsquo;d found us, that we were under attack, that, that&hellip; that it was all over!&rdquo; she exclaimed finally.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn pulled her to her chest and held her while she broke into sobs. &nbsp;She seemed to trying to pull herself together at first, but she failed and instead surrendered to her anguish. &nbsp;Her shuddering sobs gave way to wails of deep anguish. &nbsp;Kathryn looked to Patricia with alarm, who only responded with an expression of deep sympathy. &nbsp;It took several minutes for Maggie to be able to put any words together and in the meantime Kathryn just hugged her firmly and felt her poor daughter frantically cling to her as a variety of fluids poured out of her face and onto her mother&rsquo;s coverall uniform. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t try to stop her in any way, instead just holding her and letting her feel what she needed to feel as she slowly rocked her back and forth gently rubbing her back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Eventually the girl&rsquo;s wails slowed and she regained composure enough to pull back and immediately start apologizing for the mess she&rsquo;d made on her mother&rsquo;s uniform as she sniffed and took several of the tissues Patricia offered her to mop up her face.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Kathryn said, waving away her apologies. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of other uniforms,&rdquo; she tried to joke, actually getting a chuckle out of Maggie which seemed to turn something around for her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As Maggie dabbed herself with a series of tissues, Kathryn slowly rubbed her back and tried to reassure her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared too Maggie. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a scary world out there right now. &nbsp;The dramatic range of possible outcomes here is&hellip; practically beyond human understanding.&rdquo; &nbsp;She paused for a moment, considering how frank she wanted to be with her vulnerable daughter in this moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;I wish I could tell you not to worry about a thing, that it&rsquo;s all going to be okay, that everyone you care about will be back in a few days and everything&rsquo;s going to be fine. &nbsp;But you&rsquo;re too smart for that and we raised you to face the truth, even when it was ugly. &nbsp;Right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie nodded. &nbsp;She held on to a few more tissues as she looked down to the carpet on the ground, but for the moment she&rsquo;d calmed down and cleaned herself up as well as she could. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fear no truth.&rdquo; she softly whispered, a mantra she&rsquo;d been told by her parents innumerable times.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Kathryn affirmed. &nbsp;&ldquo;The hardest part is always not knowing. &nbsp;With certain tragedy you can get started grieving. &nbsp;With certain victory you can get busy celebrating and planning for what comes next. &nbsp;Not knowing which&hellip; just leaves you fearing the worst on all fronts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie looked up at her again and nodded, trying to show strength for her mother. &nbsp;&ldquo;We could win Maggie, we really could. &nbsp;We have the ships, the weapons, and a plan that really could work.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn painted it as more possible than she felt it really was, but given the moment it seemed like a fair indulgence. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And while it&rsquo;s less likely, we certainly could still lose. &nbsp;It could not be enough. &nbsp;Tomorrow might be&hellip; then end of all things.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn did her best to pull back what must have been a disturbingly haunting look in her eyes as she considered the proposition. &nbsp;&ldquo;And maybe worse, I don&rsquo;t know, we could win but you lose. &nbsp;We could win the war but our ship could be lost in the process. &nbsp;The survival of the human race could be small comfort if you lose your parents.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie&rsquo;s eyes widened in newborn alarm and Kathryn put her hand on the girl&rsquo;s should as she ignored the disapproving expression on Patricia&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;&ldquo;And while I&rsquo;ll do everything I possibly can to make sure that everyone you know and care about comes home safely, if things do go down that way, you need to remember that we did what we had to to keep you safe, that it was a necessary act of love, not just for you, but for all the kids like you, for everyone out there who has loved ones they&rsquo;re afraid to lose, that preserving your life and ensuring your future was our greatest honour, our final gift to you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie started to cry again, but this time Kathryn took her by the shoulders and looked into her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I promise you, I fucking <em>promise</em> you Maggie. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s any way <em>any fucking way</em> we can come back to you safely, we&rsquo;ll get it done. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not ready to go any more than you&rsquo;re ready to lose me, you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie seemed to understand and though she came back in for a big hug, the crying stopped. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you Mom.&rdquo; &nbsp;The words were muffled but were clear enough. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you too Maggie, more than you can imagine. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re everything to me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; ***</p>
            <p style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn woke up in the dark. &nbsp;The bed was familiar enough to recognize as the one in her bedroom on Orbital One, but the body she was intertwined with less so. &nbsp;As she came to realize she bolted upright with a start. &nbsp;She began surveying the situation more closely and recalling her most recent memories as Patricia was roused to consciousness by her bed mate&rsquo;s sudden burst of activity. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As her eyes adjusted to the dark, she watched as Patricia sat up in the bed and pushed herself back to lean against the bed&rsquo;s backboard. &nbsp;Kathryn noticed first that Patricia was still fully clothed in her white dress with pink flowers, and after noticing some blemishes on it looked down to realize she was still fully wearing the one piece coveralls Maggie had made a mess of.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn asked as she began to piece the situation together more fully as her brain finished booting up from deep sleep. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Folding her arms, Patricia folded her arms and lowered her head slightly to looked up at her in disbelief. &nbsp;&ldquo;You really think I&rsquo;d let that happen?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She remembered more and more of the night before. &nbsp;It had been late and they&rsquo;d put Maggie to bed. &nbsp;After they were sure she was asleep Kathryn opened a bottle of Roman red wine. &nbsp;Having been important to their religious ceremonies, the Catholics had carefully preserved a number of varietals on their long journey from Earth. &nbsp;Before the machines all broke down Haven had recreated other varieties from their genome, but the Roman original vines from Earth with a lineage traceable back to original French and Italian vineyards were especially prized, despite the taste being indistinguishability from the recreations. &nbsp;The bottle had been a gift from the Roman ambassador. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been saving it for a special occasion, and her impending death being somewhere between possible and probable felt like occasion enough.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she apologized, and Patricia&rsquo;s demeanour shifted to one of provisional forgiveness.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn couldn&rsquo;t remember everything they&rsquo;d said the night before, but pieces would come back to her one after another and as they did she could put them generally in the right order. &nbsp;They talked a lot about Jaren, about how he&rsquo;d changed recently, about what kinds of changes relationships can survive and what kinds they can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;She learned about some of Patricia&rsquo;s past relationships, both secret and public. &nbsp;They seemed to have gained a lot of interpersonal ground, but no recovered memories included any lines being crossed and she was grateful. &nbsp;As much as she yearned to cross lines with Patricia, for the time being those yearnings needed to remain appropriately bottled and put on the shelf for later. &nbsp;She took a brief moment to congratulate herself for sticking to the script despite the wine and the intimacy of the situation and occasion.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We talked about Maggie,&rdquo; Kathryn stated, both thinking aloud and seeking confirmation. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; she softly offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If anything happens&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn started to reiterate but found the rest of the words unnecessary.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Patricia affirmed with a few slowly affirming nods of her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; she added.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia gave a shrug which seemed to only serve to repeat: &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn came over to sit beside her on the bed and hugged her as close to the line of intimacy as she could without overtly crossing it. &nbsp;&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let it come to that,&rdquo; Patricia implored as a whisper in her ear. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come back to us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had always admired Patricia&rsquo;s ability to say so much with so little words. &nbsp;She got along with Felix so well in part because they were both more inclined to express themselves exhaustively, to say as many words as were necessary to correctly convey what they meant to say. &nbsp;She imagined it took someone more empathic than herself, someone like Patricia, to know what words actually needed to be said for the rest to be understood.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After pulling away from the hug, Kathryn indulged herself setting a toe over the line and put her hand on Patricia&rsquo;s cheek to guide her gaze up to herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any way&hellip;&rdquo; she assured her, trying her hand at saying more with less.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stood and left the room, going next door to Maggie&rsquo;s. &nbsp;She quietly pulled her desk chair over beside her bed and sat with her while she slept for a little while. &nbsp;She was trying to absorb her presence somehow, to recharge an unseen battery of resolve, to remember what this was all for, what she had to find a way to win and come home to. &nbsp;The soft light from the common area fell on the girl&rsquo;s face through the bedroom door Kathryn had left ajar, and she leaned over to brush some strands of hair out of her face which she could see stuck to her mouth, trying as she did so to burn the image into her mind as well as strongly as she could.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A soft tone from the common area interrupted her, and with a quiet heavy sigh Kathryn rose to her feet and left the room, closing the door behind her. &nbsp;She pressed the button on the wall to open the door to the suite as Patricia exited the master bedroom, likely also in response to the door tone. &nbsp;The door slid open to reveal Jaren, Felix, Bob, Margaret, Ralph, Admiral Brinkerhoff, and President Sato. &nbsp;Despite the significance and likely meaning of them all being there to call on her, Kathryn had a note of sadness at her first thought being a realization that Jaren no longer felt comfortable entering the suite unannounced. &nbsp;It clarified that something truly was broken, that he felt it not right to just welcome them into the space which on paper was still as much his as hers.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We ready then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix shrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;As much as we can be&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
