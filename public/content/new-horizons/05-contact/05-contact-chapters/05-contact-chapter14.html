            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Jaren walked into the engineering lab with purposeful intensity.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ralph. &nbsp;This is your doing isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; &nbsp;She was angry, partially contained by the continuing need to keep diplomatic options open with this entity in control of her ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; it plainly answered with its tinny voice.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why!?&rdquo; she snapped, taking a moment to breathe in and out of her nose to pull herself back before remembering to ask the more pressing question instead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. &nbsp; First of all, where are we?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are across the galaxy, in a system nearly fifty thousand light years away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The room fell silent. &nbsp;It was an answered Kathryn suspected in some deep recess of her mind but had been beyond her worst conscious fears or distant imaginings.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Kathryn asked softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;How is this possible?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I used your rift crystal to open a portal to a star in the builder&rsquo;s network,&rdquo; the robot answered matter of factly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; it reflected, &ldquo;a direct transit was not possible at such a range, we actually passed through four different portals in succession to arrive here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So they <em>can</em> inter operate&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren said to himself, his fist put to his mouth in thought.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why have you done this?&rdquo; Kathryn asked, pushing out of her mind for a moment the phantasm it was telling them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was following the instructions I had been given.&rdquo; &nbsp;It sounded almost defensive.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Which were?&rdquo; Kathryn glared.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;To establish a portal around my target star, or failing that, if possible, find a way to report home the cause of my failure. &nbsp;In the event I had been disabled, I was to likewise relay data on what force had been able to do so. &nbsp;I had already sent the transmission, but it will of course take fifty thousand of your years to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she repeated bitterly. &nbsp;&ldquo;So when we offered to take you onboard-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It presented me a more expedient opportunity, yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t we now put you out an airlock for your deception.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I would think that would be obvious,&rdquo; it answered. &nbsp;It seemed a touch confused at her ignorance. &nbsp; &ldquo;You would be stranding yourself here. &nbsp; You have no knowledge of how to activate our portals, and you have no instruments with which to navigate this system. &nbsp;I however am equipped with adequate data on both accounts. &nbsp;Beyond this, I have thoroughly permeated your systems, destroying my current or former shell would accomplish nothing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe, but it sure would feel satisfying to smash the both of you to bits,&rdquo; she glowered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right now, I only regret you can&rsquo;t feel pain.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jaren and Felix exchanged nervous glances at her uncharacteristic aggression. &nbsp; It was always there, always had been, she was just good at bottling and harnessing it towards more productive ends.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not that I have any reason to believe anything at all you might say now, I&rsquo;ll ask anyways. &nbsp;What is your endgame here?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;What will become of us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ralph hopped down onto his feet from on top of the counter with its feet dangling over the edge. &nbsp;&ldquo;I see no reason for them to harm you.&rdquo; &nbsp;The sentiment seemed non-committal, but sincere. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was sincere when I said the builders will be very interested to meet you.&rdquo; &nbsp; The once joyous idea had now seemed to have taken on a more sinister implication.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is this system?&rdquo; Jaren asked, ever practical. &nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the system of your builder&rsquo;s home world?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ralph answered before explaining. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a military research facility, the base from which I was launched. &nbsp;Opening up new worlds to the portal system is the primary peacetime mandate of the Builder&rsquo;s military, much like your Star Fleet in fact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Margaret stated, surly as ever as she approached and dripping with contempt. &nbsp;It occurred to Kathryn that angry as she was herself, Margaret might feel the most slighted. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d risked feeling kinship with him, sympathizing with him, practically vouching for him as a fellow AI. &nbsp; She was not typically inclined to grant such things, and now she was as betrayed as the rest of them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Given that you&rsquo;ve stolen our ship, have made it abundantly clear that you&rsquo;re not going to return it, and that we are helpless victims in whatever your plans for us may be, would you mind filling us in on what those plans are?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Either failing to appreciate her animosity or merely choosing to ignore it, it answered as plainly as ever. &nbsp;&ldquo;I will continue to guide this ship towards my home facility around the fourth planet. &nbsp;Once there, this vessel and its crew will be turned over to the personnel there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At their mercy,&rdquo; Margaret added acidly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ralph answered plainly, seeming to fail to understand what the problem was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What kind of reception do you expect for us?&rdquo; Jaren asked. &nbsp; &ldquo;Are we looking forward to a diplomatic celebration of first contact, or&hellip; dissection.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The face on the screen betrayed a new understanding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Admiral,&rdquo; he offered, looking at Kathryn, &ldquo;I believe I have errored and presented a false impression.&rdquo; &nbsp;It managed to sound genuinely sympathetic, if not overwhelmingly so. &nbsp;&ldquo;You should understand that my orders were not to capture what life I encountered for study, nor were they explicitly to commandeer your ship. &nbsp;I have done what I have only because it was the only remaining option available to me with which I could complete my mission. &nbsp;The Builders are a noble and enlightened race. &nbsp;They are neither war mongers nor meddling mischiefs. &nbsp; The most celebrated moments in their history are times when they made new contact with technologically capable species.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We feel the same way,&rdquo; Kathryn responded, newly hopeful despite herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;So why are you surrendering us to them by force like this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because my mission must succeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn dropped her head and sighed heavily as she put her hands on her hips. &nbsp;He seemed to be talking in circles. &nbsp;&ldquo;Could you all give us the room please?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren and Felix exchanged another uncertain glance, she noticed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Quite sure, go on. &nbsp;I want to talk with him alone for a moment. &nbsp;I promise I won&rsquo;t break him,&rdquo; she told him with a wink and a mischievous smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren and the others all shuffled uncertainly out of the room as she asked. &nbsp;Once the door had closed behind them, after a few moments of scrutinizing the robot&rsquo;s expressionless face, she reached over and slowly pulled two chairs over and set them facing each other. &nbsp;She sat down in one and gestured with her hand an invitation for Ralph&rsquo;s robot body to do the same.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She looked at the floor and pursed her lips in thought for several moments, collecting her thoughts before looking back up at him. &nbsp; &ldquo;Ralph, I need you to return control of this ship to us,&rdquo; she stated as clearly as she could.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But you still-&rdquo; his response was cut off by Kathryn raising of her hand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Ralph, I understand that we cannot open a portal to get home without your assistance. &nbsp;I understand that we are flying blind without your knowledge of this system. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;Being helpless prisoners on our own ship is an absolutely untenable situation for us. &nbsp;What you&rsquo;ve done is unacceptable and unforgiveable even if it were understandable. &nbsp; You need to understand that we are duty bound to figure out how to regain control of this ship and her arsenal at any and all costs. &nbsp;If we are unable to do this, the same duty demands we destroy the ship rather than let it fall into enemy hands.&rdquo; &nbsp;The face on the head screen tilted slightly in consideration. &nbsp;&ldquo;However,&rdquo; she drew in breath hoping to suck up some pride, &ldquo;we will cooperate with you if you allow us to run this operation with you collaboratively, as a partnership,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; it stated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Let us fly our own damn ship, Ralph. &nbsp;We shouldn&rsquo;t be here at all. &nbsp;A different crew in an intact ship should be the ones on this mission, but there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that now. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re dead set on introducing us to your builders well, we certainly would have preferred it to happen under different circumstances and on our own terms, but ultimately we want the same thing, especially if they are a peaceful and enlightened culture as you claim. &nbsp;If you release control of this ship to us, and provide us with a navigational model of the system, we will fly to the designated planet willingly and in peace as ambassadors on a political first contact mission.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That would be acceptable,&rdquo; he answered after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;After all, there&rsquo;s nowhere else you can go, and I can take control again at any time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Reflexively Kathryn gritted her teeth the right corner of her mouth curled up, a common tick when she was suppressing rage and a small flare escaped. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes Ralph, I am aware of that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He looked at her plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The alternative is returning to our duty trying to stop you. &nbsp; Take our chances dissecting you for your data and try to hack your portal system ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You would fail,&rdquo; Ralph&rsquo;s robot avatar stated matter of factly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe, but we&rsquo;d try. &nbsp;And if left with no other options, we would destroy the ship rather than surrender it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She could tell from his expression that this was an outcome he was compelled to avoid at all costs, that it would equally constitute an unacceptable mission failure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s a deal then? &nbsp;You give us control and navigation data on this system, and we take you to your world for willing and peaceful introductions with your builders by our own means?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;I agree to your terms, Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Grand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn exited the engineering bay and once it closed, she leaned back against the door and sighed heavily. &nbsp;When she opened her eyes, she saw everyone&rsquo;s faces expectantly waiting for her to tell them what happened. &nbsp;&ldquo;In exchange for returning control of the ship and providing us with navigational data for this system,&rdquo; she recounted, &ldquo;we are going to willingly proceed to the fourth planet to meet these builders.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She reached over to touch the comm panel beside the door and hailed the bridge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Lieutenant Byrne, you should have control of the ship now. &nbsp;Please confirm.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After a pause Byrne responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Aye Admiral. &nbsp;I have full control at the helm.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Stand by for navigational data from the AI and once received please plot a course for the fourth planet and engage at one and a half Gs.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aye Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn switched off the channel. &nbsp;Slack jawed, she rubbed her chin as she considered what orders to issue. &nbsp;&ldquo;Two teams,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix, I want you and whoever can help you to study how he took control of the system. &nbsp; Map out the full extent of its control, as in can it hear us right now over the comm system. &nbsp;Learn about how it took control and figure out how to break it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what we can, Admiral.&rdquo; &nbsp;He nodded his understanding and she nodded back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren, please lead the science team in studying our rift transit. &nbsp; Study the transmission logs and sensor data from our approach, transit, and exit of our transit. &nbsp;I know it&rsquo;s a long shot, but I want to know in what way their network is different and how the two were bridged. &nbsp;Best case scenario, figure out how to hack it so we can get back on our own power.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That will be&hellip;&rdquo; he started with a shake of his head, but when he looked up at her he saw the raised eyebrow she was giving him. &nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get on it right away, Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Once the cat is out of the bag with these builders,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be able to exit any of our home world rift points. &nbsp;More important than anything else is figuring out how to block their access if we need to and get that information home.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on everyone,&rdquo; he called out as he ushered them all away to their duties. &nbsp; Everyone left but Patricia who remained, fixed on Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; she asked with her usual sweet sincerity.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This really isn&rsquo;t the time for this, Patricia.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she hesitated with a note of frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress. &nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t had much chance to sleep. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m worried about you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was hard to keep cold to someone she&rsquo;d been so intimate with. &nbsp; They&rsquo;d never fallen out; the attraction had never gone away; she&rsquo;d just had to force herself to stop. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t want to be cruelly cold to her, but neither could she give in to their latent intimacy. &nbsp;It could be a difficult balancing act.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright, Patricia. &nbsp;Thank you for your concern. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll take a while to get to the builder&rsquo;s planet; I should have the opportunity to get some rest. &nbsp;We all should.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Patricia pursed a corner of her lips as she turned to leave, resisting to say whatever else it was she might have wanted to. &nbsp;Before she could leave Kathryn grabbed her hand to stop her, lowering her head in defeat as she did so, and Patricia&rsquo;s already wide big brown eyes widened even further in surprise.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Patricia&hellip;&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;How about you? &nbsp;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The woman seemed touched. &nbsp;Kathryn usually avoided paying any attention to her whatsoever, not since&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am alright, thank you,&rdquo; she answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Rattled like the rest of the crew is certainly, but&hellip; okay. &nbsp; I wish there was more I could do to help.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A thought raised Kathryn&rsquo;s eyebrow. &nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, there <em>is</em> something you could do for me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; Patricia answered reflexively and then blushed in embarrassment, causing Kathryn to smile at her sweetness, at her perpetual innocence despite everything she&rsquo;d been through over the years.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please watch over Maggie. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m worried sick having her on the ship. &nbsp;She shouldn&rsquo;t be here, but she is and Jaren and I are too busy with our duties to take care of her and make sure she&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Patricia answered with a smile and nod.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Kathryn said, releasing her hand she realized she was still holding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, to that end, why don&rsquo;t you join us for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I think it would be better if Margaret and I both joined you, but yes thank you, I appreciate the invite.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, good thinking,&rdquo; Kathryn remarked, surprised he same cautionary thought hadn&rsquo;t occurred to her first. &nbsp;&ldquo;See you there soon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;An hour later, Kathryn was having dinner with her daughter, Patricia, and Margaret in Jaren&rsquo;s quarters. &nbsp;He was absorbed in his work and had told them to go ahead without him, that he&rsquo;d have just have the galley send something down to him and his people in the lab. &nbsp;Given the circumstances, Kathryn didn&rsquo;t want to pull him away from productive work. &nbsp; Besides, having invited Patricia, she was a little relieved he wouldn&rsquo;t be joining them anyways.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They were eating what passed for sushi on an interstellar research vessel fifty thousand light years from Earth, which meant quite edible, but certainly far from divine. &nbsp;They had just finished recounting to Maggie everything which had happened since losing control of the ship in the 61 Cygni system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet him,&rdquo; the girl said as she tried to pull a sushi piece too laden with soy sauce into her mouth and spilled on her shirt. &nbsp; She frowned at her error as she looked down at the dark patch on her blue and white horizontally striped fitted t-shirt her usual elegance had been stressed by still adjusting to her most recent growth spurt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Honestly not in love with the idea sweetheart,&rdquo; Kathryn considered, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not totally out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hard to describe, really&hellip; off-putting at first certainly, angering in his actions now for sure, but you get used to him pretty quickly really, quicker than you&rsquo;d think. &nbsp;Everything he says is just a little bit off since he&rsquo;s using our databanks to know how to communicate but isn&rsquo;t native to our society or language.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; the girl mused. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know this isn&rsquo;t the mission you thought you were bringing me along on, Mom.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn laughed out loud, exchanging smiles with Margaret and Patricia. &nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly not! &nbsp;Not by a long shot I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she answered with a sigh.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am learning a lot though,&rdquo; Maggie reflected, &ldquo;not just school kind of stuff, but like&hellip; about why you and Dad like this kind of stuff, what brings you out here, the appeal of discovery and the unknown, all that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it sweetie. &nbsp;I meant <em>that&rsquo;s</em> why you&rsquo;re really here after all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl said, as though she were insulted at the suggestion that she didn&rsquo;t know that was why they&rsquo;d agreed to bring her along. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make an explorer out of you yet,&rdquo; Margaret told her with a wink as she raise her wine glass to her mouth.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It <em>is</em> exciting though&hellip;&rdquo; Maggie said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen? &nbsp;Real unknowns&hellip; having no idea what we&rsquo;re flying into and what we might find when we get there?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Kathryn harrumphed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Try doing it with your teenaged daughter aboard.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie gave her the look reiterating: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fourteen Mom, I&rsquo;m not a baby.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still though hon,&rdquo; Kathryn continued, answering her unspoken words, &ldquo;you can imagine how much more stressful that would make it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; the girl said as she more carefully maneuvered another piece of sushi into her mouth, successfully this time but just barely.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ve got a lot more to write about than you&rsquo;d expected,&rdquo; Patricia offered as Maggie chewed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You already have something new written, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl nodded but seemed embarrassed. &nbsp;Kathryn surmised she had confided in Patricia but hadn&rsquo;t yet wanted to share with her mother.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can I see?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Maggie said with a nervous laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really only just notes at this point!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, alright&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn answered, throwing her hands up in exaggerated exasperation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look Maggie&hellip; I know you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself, but&hellip; still. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry for getting you into this. &nbsp;It was a bad idea to bring you along from the beginning.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo; the girl answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s really hard on you and Dad, but honestly there&rsquo;s nowhere in the galaxy I&rsquo;d rather be right now than here with you all on the ship. &nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine being back on the station just wondering if you&rsquo;re still alive or ever going to come back.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Kathryn nodded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to keep you safe. &nbsp;I mean I&rsquo;d say the same for every crew member under my command, but&hellip; you know what I mean. &nbsp; Look, just don&rsquo;t expect any more field trips at this point, okay?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Maggie responded non-committally as though she were the adult talking to her daughter which made Kathryn chuckle. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked Patricia to look out for you going forward and she&rsquo;s agreed, so please stay close to her, alright?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the girl started to give the &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a baby&rsquo; look again, Kathryn cut her short. &nbsp;&ldquo;No attitude Maggie. &nbsp;Just stay close to Patricia and let her try to keep you safe, alright?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl tilted her head to the side in thought, then looked over at Patricia who smiled back in response. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Kathryn said, satisfied.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyways,&rdquo; Maggie offered, changing the subject. &nbsp;&ldquo;So when can I meet this Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Kathryn answered with a wink.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The next day, a several hours out from the flip and deceleration midpoint of their journey, with Patricia and Maggie in tow, Kathryn visited Jaren in the main science lab where he and his team were working on decoding the alien portal system. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d hardly slept let alone left the lab since she&rsquo;d assigned him the task. &nbsp;He seemed uncharacteristically desperate to make progress. &nbsp;Kathryn surmised that he&rsquo;d connected his success with the safety of his daughter, leaving little which could deter him from the work. &nbsp;Truth was they hadn&rsquo;t been talking personally much lately. &nbsp;So far she&rsquo;d written it off as them both just being so busy and wrapped up in their work, but wondering if there was something else going on had begun to gnaw at her subconscious.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed in exhausted frustration as he rubbed his face with the palms of both hands, &ldquo;we have an increasingly clear picture of the impossibility of deciphering the system. &nbsp;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Better than total ignorance?&rdquo; she tried to offer in encouragement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He chuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose it is Kat, I suppose it is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take Maggie to meet Ralph and ask him some more questions. &nbsp;You want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He gave a look which indicated his discomfort with the idea of putting his daughter in the same room as a hostile artificial intelligence in a robot body, but seemed to decide against protesting it. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d&hellip; I&rsquo;d better stay here and plumb further the depths of the impossibility of our task.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; she said, affectionately gripping his shoulder. &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if we turn up anything useful.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren nodded appreciatively and returned to his work.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few minutes later they arrived at the door to the engineering lab where Ralph was supposedly quarantined. &nbsp;As soon as the door entered, the robot moved towards them and the apparent aggression startled Maggie, causing her to tighten up to her mother and half hide behind her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain, I have a concern which I need to address with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course, Ralph. &nbsp;But first I&rsquo;d like you to meet my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The robot paused for a moment to regard the girl. &nbsp; &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; was all he said before returning his attention to Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a concern I need to address with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;As you said,&rdquo; Kathryn said as she gestured to the table and chairs for him and the others to sit. &nbsp;&ldquo;What is it, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;His tone of concern and the way it almost bordered on panic was something she&rsquo;d never heard in the simulated voice and it immediately fired off her own internal alarm bells.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Infinity Base is not responding the way that it should.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Infinity Base?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the closest approximation of a translation I could come up with. &nbsp;I have been unable to reach them, nor can I detect any transmissions from them. &nbsp;At first I surmised that this ship was too badly damaged to send or receive any messages, or that the respective transceiver technologies were fundamentally incapable, but upon further study I have concluded that neither are the case. &nbsp;This ship should be able to receive and transmit to Infinity Base, but no responses or initiating transmissions have been received from them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; was all Kathryn could answer. &nbsp;She had no idea what to make of it, but Ralph seemed to be making a great deal of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;drone ships should have intercepted us by now to investigate our presence if communications were not established, and there are no drone ships out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shook her head in frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;Again Ralph, drone ships intercepting us is really something you should have warned us about.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; the robot exclaimed. &nbsp;He actually seemed panicked, and though she didn&rsquo;t outwardly show it, he was causing a growing panic in her as well. &nbsp; &ldquo;Infinity Base must have been disabled or destroyed; nothing in the known galaxy could challenge a Builder facility in this way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe the base was just abandoned?&rdquo; Kathryn suggested. &nbsp;&ldquo;You <em>have</em> been gone a really, <em>really</em> long time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he answered, a little calmer and more reflective as he considered he possibility. &nbsp;&ldquo;They would have left a relay station of some sort to send and receive transmission from returning ships like myself. &nbsp;Something is definitely wrong, but we won&rsquo;t know what has happened until we arrive. &nbsp; I assume you are still comfortable with the terms of our arrangement given this change in mission from a formal introduction to an investigation and possible rendering of assistance?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never comfortable with our arrangement Ralph, I only accepted it.&rdquo; she clarified. &nbsp;&ldquo;However, if there is a chance that someone at Infinity Base is in need of our assistance, we will continue on willingly. &nbsp;We are after all honour bound to render assistance where possible, after all that&rsquo;s we allowed you to steal our ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Please Admiral, drop the pretense. &nbsp;You did not rescue me as much as you scavenged me from my ship for your own ends; let&rsquo;s not pretend.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn didn&rsquo;t like his saying it but could not refute what he said. &nbsp;She instead slowly rapped her fingers in sequence against the table several times as she considered the options. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are honour bound to render assistance where possible,&rdquo; she repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will continue on to Infinity Base and see if we can help you determine what has happened. &nbsp;What are you programmed to do if you are unable to report in here?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I would need to travel back through the portal to other bases in attempt to report in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded her understanding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph, we can&rsquo;t continue on like this. &nbsp;If it comes to that, will you consider a compromise?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; it invited.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If we are unable to contact your builders in this system, allow my people to return home in this ship. &nbsp;I will come with you in one of our shuttles wherever else you need to go to find your people if you agree.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Mom!</em>&rdquo; Maggie cried out reflexively the prospect of losing her mother, and Patricia put a comforting arm around her as Kathryn put her hand up to quiet her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The robot seemed to look down in thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;This might be agreeable, but I cannot commit to this until I see what has happened at Infinity Base.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; she said, and started to get up.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One more thing Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You need not attempt to mask your efforts to circumvent my control; they are plainly apparent and do not offend. &nbsp;I would be surprised if you were <em>not</em> attempting to do so.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded respectfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you. &nbsp;I will instruct my people they can work more openly. &nbsp;Now, Ralph. &nbsp;As I said I&rsquo;d like you to meet my daughter&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
