            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Jaren walked into the engineering lab with intensity of purpose.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ralph. &nbsp; This is your doing isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why!?&rdquo; she asked, then asked the more pressing question instead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, first where are we?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We are across the galaxy, in a system nearly fifty thousand light years away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The room fell silent. &nbsp;This was beyond any of their worst fears or distant imaginings.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Kathryn asked softly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I used your portal system to open a portal to a star in the builder&rsquo;s network,&rdquo; the robot answered matter of factly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; it reflected, &ldquo;a direct transit was not possible at that range, we actually passed through four different portals in succession to arrive here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why have you done this?&rdquo; Kathryn asked, pushing out of her mind for a moment the marvel of what he was telling them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was following the instructions I had been given.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Which were?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Establish a portal around my target star, or failing that find a way to report home the cause of my failure if possible. &nbsp;In the event I had been disabled, I was to likewise relay data on what force had been able to do so. &nbsp;I had already sent a transmission, but that will of course take fifty thousand of your years to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she repeated bitterly. &nbsp;&ldquo;So when we offered to take you onboard-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It presented me a more expedient opportunity, yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So now why shouldn&rsquo;t we put you out an airlock for your deception.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I would think that would be obvious. &nbsp;You would be stranding yourself here. &nbsp;You have no knowledge of how to activate our portals, and you have no way to navigate your way through this system. &nbsp;I however am equipped with adequate data on both accounts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not that I have any reason to believe anything you say anymore, but what is your endgame here? &nbsp; What will become of us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ralph hopped down onto his feet from the position he&rsquo;d been in sitting on the counter with his feet dangling over the edge. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have no reason to think you will be harmed,&rdquo; he offered non-committally. &nbsp; &ldquo;As I said earlier, I believe the builders will be very interested to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is this system?&rdquo; Jaren asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is it their homeworld?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a military research facility. &nbsp;It is the base from which I was launched. &nbsp;Opening up new worlds to the portal system is the primary peacetime mandate of the builder&rsquo;s military, much like your Star Fleet in fact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Margaret stated, surly as ever as she approached. &nbsp;&ldquo;Given that you&rsquo;ve stolen our ship, have made it abundantly clear that you&rsquo;re not going to return it, and that we are helpless victims in whatever your plans are, would you mind filling us in on what those plans are?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice was dripping with contempt, as though she felt personally betrayed by him more than any of the others.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Either choosing to ignore or not recognizing her animosity, he answered plainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I will continue to guide this ship to the facility around the fourth planet. &nbsp;There this vessel and its crew will be turned over to the personnel there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At their mercy,&rdquo; Margaret added acidly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ralph answered plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What kind of reception do you expect for us?&rdquo; Jaren asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Diplomatic celebration at first contact, or dissection.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The face on the screen betrayed his understanding anew of something he had not preciously appreciated. &nbsp;&ldquo;Captain, you must understand that my orders were not to capture what life I encountered for study, nor were they explicitly to commandeer your ship. &nbsp;What I have done was the only options available to me in completing my mission. &nbsp;The builders are a noble and enlightened race. &nbsp;They are neither war mongers nor meddling mischiefs. &nbsp;The most celebrated moments in their history are times when they made new contact with technologically capable species.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We feel the same way,&rdquo; Kathryn said, &ldquo;so why will we be surrendered to them by force this way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Because my mission must succeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sighed heavily and put her hands on her hips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Could you all give us the room please?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure, go. &nbsp;I want to talk with him alone for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;All of the others shuffled uncertainly out of the room. &nbsp;Once the door had closed behind them, Kathryn reached over and pulled two chairs over and set them facing each other. &nbsp;She sat down in one, gesturing with her hand an invitation for Ralph&rsquo;s robot body to do the same.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She pursed her lips as she looked at the floor beside him before looking up at his face screen to speak. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to return control of this ship to us,&rdquo; she stated unusually clearly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But you still-&rdquo; his response was cut off by the raising of her hand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, we can go nowhere without your help opening a portal. &nbsp;Yes we are flying blind without your knowledge of this system. &nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;Being helpless prisoners on our own ship is absolutely untenable. &nbsp;What you&rsquo;ve done is unacceptable and unforgiveable even if it is understandable. &nbsp; However, we will cooperate if we run this operation as a partnership, as a collaboration.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Let us fly our own damn ship. &nbsp;We shouldn&rsquo;t be here, a different crew in an intact ship should be but there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that now. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re dead set on introducing us to your builders and we want the same thing though we would have preferred different circumstances. &nbsp;If you release control of this ship and provide us with a navigational model of the system, we will fly to the designated planet of our own will as ambassadors on a political first contact mission.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That would be acceptable,&rdquo; he answered after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;After all, there&rsquo;s nowhere else you can go and I can take control again at any time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn gritted her teeth and with not so subtle anger: &ldquo;Yes, I am aware of that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He looked at her plainly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The alternative is us being duty bound to try to stop you. &nbsp;Take our chances dissecting you for data and trying to hack this portal system on our own.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You would fail,&rdquo; Ralph&rsquo;s robot avatar stated matter of factly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe, but we&rsquo;d definitely try.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a deal then? &nbsp;You give us navigation data on this system and we take you to your world for introductions under our own control.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, a deal.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Grand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn exited the engineering bay and leaned back against the door once it closed behind her, sighing heavily. &nbsp;Everyone was standing in front of her waiting for her to tell them what had happened. &nbsp; &ldquo;In exchange for returning control of the ship, he is going to provide us with navigation data and we are going to proceed to the fourth planet.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She reached over to touch the comm panel beside the door, hailing the bridge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pilot, you should have control now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After a pause Aisha responded: &ldquo;aye Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Stand by for navigation data from the A.I. once received plot a course for the fourth planet and engage at one and a half gees.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aye Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn switched off the channel. &nbsp;She rubbed her chin as she considered orders for them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Two teams,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix, I want you and whoever can help you to study how it took control of the system, and determine the full extent of its control as in, can it hear us right now over the comm system. &nbsp;Learn about how it did that and figure out how to break it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sure do what I can Kat.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She nodded at him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren, science team. &nbsp;I want you to study the transmission logs and sensor data from our approach, transit, and exit during that rift trip. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a long shot but I want to know in what way their system is different, and how the two were bridged. &nbsp;Best case scenario, figure out how to hack it so we can get back on our own power.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That will be&hellip;&rdquo; he started with a shake of his head, but when he looked up at her he saw the raised eyebrow she was giving him. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll&hellip; get on it right away. &nbsp;Come on everyone,&rdquo; he called out as he ushered them all away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;An hour later, Kathryn was having dinner alone with her daughter in her and Jaren&rsquo;s quarters. &nbsp; He was absorbed in his work and had told them to go ahead without him, that he&rsquo;d have something sent down to him and his people in the lab. &nbsp;They were eating what passed for sushi on an interstellar research vessel which meant quite edible, but far from divine. &nbsp;She had just finished recounting to her daughter everything which had happened since she first learned that they had lost control of the ship in the 61 Cygni system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet him,&rdquo; Maggie said as she tried to pull a sushi piece too laden with soy sauce to her mouth and spilled on her shirt. &nbsp;She frowned at her error as she looked down at the dark patch on her blue and white horizontally striped fitted t shirt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in love with the idea,&rdquo; Kathryn considered, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not out of the question.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hard to describe&hellip; off-putting at first certainly, angering in his actions definitely, but you get used to him rather quickly, quicker than you&rsquo;d think. &nbsp; Everything he says is just a little bit off, betraying that he&rsquo;s using our databanks to know how to communicate but isn&rsquo;t native to our society or language.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; the girl mused. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know this isn&rsquo;t the mission you thought you were bringing me along on.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn laughed out loud. &nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly not! &nbsp;Not by a long shot&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I am learning a lot though&hellip;&rdquo; Maggie reflected, &ldquo;not just school kind of stuff, but&hellip; about why you and Dad like this kind of stuff, what brings you out here, the appeal of discovery and the unknown&hellip; that kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it sweetie. &nbsp;<em>That&rsquo;s</em> why you&rsquo;re here after all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the girl said, as though she were insulted at the suggestion that she didn&rsquo;t know that was why they&rsquo;d agreed to bring her along. &nbsp;&ldquo;It <em>is</em> exciting though&hellip; not knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen, the thrill of the true unknown, not knowing what we&rsquo;re flying into or what might happen.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Kathryn harrumphed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Try doing it with your teenaged daughter aboard.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie gave her that look which reiterated the sentiment of: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fourteen Mom, I&rsquo;m not a baby.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Kathryn said, answering her unspoken words, &ldquo;you can imagine how much more stressful that would make it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; the girl said as she manoeuvered another piece into her mouth, successfully this time, but barely.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ve got a lot more to write about than you&rsquo;d expected,&rdquo; her mother said as the daughter chewed. &nbsp;&ldquo;In fact if I know you you&rsquo;ve already got something written don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl nodded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can I see?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Maggie said with a laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little more than notes at this point!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, alright&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn answered, throwing her hands up in exaggerated exasperation. &nbsp; &ldquo;Look Maggie&hellip; I know you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself, but&hellip; still. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry for getting you into this. &nbsp;It was a bad idea from the beginning to bring you along.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; the girl answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s really hard on you and Dad, but honestly there&rsquo;s nowhere in the galaxy I&rsquo;d rather be right now than here with you all on the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All the same&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to keep you safe, but I&rsquo;d say the same for every crew member under my command. &nbsp;Look, just don&rsquo;t expect any more field trips at this point okay?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Maggie responded non-committaly as though she were the adult talking to her daughter, which made Kathryn chuckle. &nbsp;&ldquo;Anyways, so can I meet this Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Kathryn said with a wink.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The next day, a several hours out from the flip and deceleration midpoint of their journey, Kathryn with Maggie in tow visited Jaren in the main science lab where he and his team were working on decoding the alien portal system. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d hardly slept let alone left the lab since she&rsquo;d assigned him the task, desperate as he was to make progress. &nbsp;She knew that once he&rsquo;d connected his success with the safety of his daughter, little could be done to deter him from the work.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed in exhausted frustration as he rubbed his face with the palms of both hands, &ldquo;we have an increasingly clear picture of the impossibility of deciphering the system. &nbsp;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Better than total ignorance?&rdquo; she encouraged.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He chuckled. &nbsp; &ldquo;It is indeed that hon, it is indeed that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take Maggie to meet Ralph and ask him some more questions. &nbsp;You want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He gave a look which indicated his discomfort with the idea of putting his daughter in the same room as the hostile artificial intelligence in a robot body, but decided against protest. &nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip; I&rsquo;d better stay here and further plumb the depths of the impossibility of our task.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; she said as the affectionately gripped his shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if we turn up something useful.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren waved her off and returned to his work.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few minutes later they arrived at the door to the engineering lab where Ralph was supposedly quarantined. &nbsp;As soon as the door entered, the robot moved towards them and the apparent aggression startled Maggie and the tightened up to her mother&rsquo;s side, now half behind her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain, I have a concern I need to address with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course Ralph, but first, I&rsquo;d like you to meet my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The robot paused for a moment to regard the girl. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; was all he said before resuming his address to Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a concern I need to address with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn gestured to the table and chairs and directed the other to sit along with her. &nbsp; &ldquo;What is it Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;The tone of concern, perhaps even bordering on panic was something she&rsquo;d never heard in the simulated voice and it immediately concerned her as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Infinity Base isn&rsquo;t responding the way they should.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Infinity Base?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the closest approximation of a translation I could come up with. &nbsp;I have been unable to reach them nor receive transmissions from them. &nbsp;At first I surmised that this ship was too badly damaged to send or receive, or the technologies incompatible, but neither is the case. &nbsp;This ship should be able to receive and transmit to Infinity Base, but no responses or initiating transmissions have been received.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; was all Kathryn could answer. &nbsp;She had no idea what to make of it but Ralph apparently made a great deal of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, by now drone ships should have intercepted us to investigate if communications were not established, and there are no drone ships out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Again, you could have warned us about drone interceptors Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; the robot exclaimed, scaring Kathryn below an exterior which would never betray it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Infinity Base has been crippled or destroyed. &nbsp;Nothing in the known galaxy could do such a thing to a builder facility.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe the base was just abandoned?&rdquo; Kathryn suggested. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have been gone a <em>really</em> long time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he answered, calmer and more reflective now. &nbsp;&ldquo;They would have left a relay station of some sort to send and receive transmission from ships such as myself. &nbsp;Something is definitely wrong, but we won&rsquo;t know what until we arrive. &nbsp; I assume you are still comfortable with the terms of our arrangement given this change in mission from a formal introduction to an investigation and possible rendering of assistance?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was never comfortable with our arrangement Ralph but I did accept it. &nbsp;However, if there is a chance of someone at Infinity Base in need of assistance, we will willingly continue on. &nbsp;We are after all honour bound to render assistance where possible, after all that&rsquo;s how you were able to come aboard and steal our ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Please Kathryn, drop the pretense. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t rescue me, you scavenged me from my ship. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s not pretend.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn didn&rsquo;t like what he said, but she didn&rsquo;t refute his statement. &nbsp;She instead slowly rapped her fingers against the table several times as she thought. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are honour bound to render assistance where possible,&rdquo; she repeated. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will continue on to Infinity Base and help you determine what happened. &nbsp;What we do next we will decide then based on what we find. &nbsp;Agreed?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Agreed. &nbsp; One more thing Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You need not attempt to mask your efforts to circumvent my control; they are plain to me and they do not offend. &nbsp;I would be disappointed in you if you were not attempting to do so.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded respectfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;I will instruct my people they can work more openly. &nbsp;Now, Ralph. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like you to meet my daughter&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
