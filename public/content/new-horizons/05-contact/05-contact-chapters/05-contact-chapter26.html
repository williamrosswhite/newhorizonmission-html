            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When they drew down the solidity of the barrier between their ship and the corridor leading onto the station, all seemed quiet. &nbsp;Like on other Bobbin facilities, the walls were a dull black lit by a uniformly bright ceiling. &nbsp;It was bright enough to be able to see adequately well, but it was still dim enough to be uneasily eerie.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They cautiously made their way through the ship, alternating their personnel. &nbsp;Bill was first, followed by Kathryn, then another Bobbin, then Jaren and Ralph with a Bobbin between them, then Margaret taking up the rear behind another Bobbin. &nbsp;She had insisted in taking this important position and was clearly taking her position very seriously.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;So far it appeared that their signal modulators were working, they seemed to have triggered no intruder alarms nor defensive measures. &nbsp;Unless one of the enemy Bobbins encountered them visually, their entry shouldn&rsquo;t be detected. &nbsp;At one point Bill stopped them and indicated that an enemy Bobbin was nearby and they held position until he signaled to them that they were clear to continue.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When they arrived to the central computer core area, they knelt down and waited. &nbsp; Staying still in this one spot was one of the most harrowing part of their plan. &nbsp;If an enemy Bobbin happened by they would see him coming on their scanners ahead of time, but it would be tricky moving everyone out of its way without either it or the one stationed at the core noticing. &nbsp;Fortunately no one happened by. &nbsp;So far they&rsquo;d been lucky.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;For about five minutes, Bill held his scanner up, carefully recording all of the signals being transmitted between the Bobbin in question and the computer core. &nbsp;At this point he passed the device he&rsquo;d been using back to Kathryn, who handed it off in a chain until it reached Ralph. &nbsp; He put a metallic hand over the device and closed his cartoonish simulated image of eyes as he interfaced with it. &nbsp;A few minutes later the projected eyes opened again and he informed them all that he was ready.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They were all aware that if this worked at all there was no way to know for how long it would last, and if it didn&rsquo;t work at all, their lives were about to get very interesting and possibly very brief. &nbsp;Ralph received a somber nod from Bill though, and it was time. &nbsp;Again he closed the eyes on his image of a face to indicate concentration, and then sharply opened them again and gave a nod to indicate that it was working. &nbsp;He had successfully taken the place of the Bobbin in question in the local Link network, and apparently with nothing and nobody knowing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;With a taloned bony finger Bill pointed towards the Bobbin between Jaren and Ralph. &nbsp;This was the one who had seen fit to strap two relatively large for its body black bladed swords to its sides. &nbsp;Now they would come to understand why. &nbsp;As it came forward it withdrew both and wielded one in each hand. &nbsp;Kathryn was so surprised and a little creeped out the way it made absolutely no sound as it passed her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d had pretty comprehensive tactical training, but she&rsquo;d never seen a human move that silently. &nbsp;There was always the slightest sound which was easily overlooked if not attuned to it but detectable when paying attention. &nbsp;There was no such tell with this one. &nbsp;It could have been a purely visual projection for all the other indications of its presence it betrayed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It advanced ahead of them, and still there was silence for what seemed like an eternity but in reality couldn&rsquo;t have been more than two minutes. &nbsp;Finally it emerged from around the corridor corner again and communicated that it was all clear, which was relayed by Bill with a wave of his hand. &nbsp;Kathryn was stunned by what she saw when she rounded the corner. &nbsp;It was a decapitated Bobbin in a massive pool of red blood. &nbsp; She was surprised at how much its blood looked exactly like human blood. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t sure if she had necessarily expected it to be different, if she&rsquo;d ever articulated the thought, but to see it now these wildly different aliens seemed a little less removed from herself somehow, and for the first time really.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She looked over the body as Bill and another Bobbin (not the dual sword wielding one who instead stood watch at a nearby corridor intersection), excitedly interfaced with the computer terminal. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d seemed to have completely ignored the body and this bothered her a little. &nbsp;Yes they were enemies, yes they were engaged in a brutal civil war, but it was still one of their species. &nbsp;Necessary as it may be sometimes, a violent unnatural death was always a tragedy of some degree, worthy of some noting at least she felt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The head was a couple of meters away. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t appear to have rolled either. &nbsp;As she carefully knelt down to inspect the body she noticed a massive through wound on its torso as well. &nbsp;It looked as though the assailant had grabbed the top of the central projection firmly and swiped it loose with a sword before then plunging the same sword into the torso before casually dropping the head as it returned to them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Though she was a trained military officer she&rsquo;d never fought a war. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d never seen a violent death like this and it affected her more than she was expecting. &nbsp;It also wasn&rsquo;t clear if it was affecting her more than it ordinarily would given that it was an alien. &nbsp;Would it have bothered her more to have seen the head of one of her own so casually cast aside, or to know that alien life forms millions of years more advanced than humans still had it in them to be so casually violent when things got bad enough. &nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill and his comrade finished working at the computer terminal. &nbsp;They had successfully downloaded into the all of the Bobbin&rsquo;s internal circuitry the content of the enemy Link since it separated from their own, and they were ready to leave. &nbsp;Now was the time to leave Ralph here and go after Maggie. &nbsp;Kathryn watched as Margaret went up to Ralph and gingerly put her hand on the side of his screen head. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t say goodbye, or anything else for that matter, she just held her hand there for a moment before coming along with the rest of them with a bitter scowl on her face. &nbsp;Kathryn didn&rsquo;t understand what her connection with him was, especially with how mocking and dismissive she&rsquo;d been of him and the robot he now inhabited from the beginning. &nbsp; No time to worry about it now though.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was no permanent corridor to Maggie&rsquo;s suite as there was to the computer core, so instead Bill accessed the ship&rsquo;s internal matter manipulation system and the square section of the hallway they were in slid into the wall, with the opposite side of the corridor following them in, presumably to be replaced with a fresh incarnation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took several minutes since the holding cell was clear across the ship, but finally one of the walls melted away, and they were conjoined with the room Maggie was still asleep in. &nbsp;Margaret and Jaren rushed over to her and did a rudimentary checking her over, ensuring that she was still breathing and her heart was still beating. &nbsp;The data they&rsquo;d gathered from the ship had told them as much, but their inability to wake her up deeply troubled them. &nbsp;Before long Bill urged them that they could thoroughly examine her once back on their ship but that right now it was imperative to return and get away. &nbsp;They were so close to a perfectly executed successful mission they absolutely had to escape now while they still could.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She accepted this, and took Jaren&rsquo;s wand from him as he picked her up and carried her. &nbsp; Bill put a sensor dampener on her as well before leaving a different piece of hardware on the bed. &nbsp;He informed them that it would mimic her life signs but again cautioned that while passive sensors would be fooled, if a video feed of the room was drawn up the rouse would come to an end. &nbsp;As they stepped back into the room which had been formed out of the corridor they&rsquo;d previously been in, the wall reappeared and they were in transit again, though there was no sensory indication of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked down at her poor daughter&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;It was dirty, clearly unwashed since they&rsquo;d lost her. &nbsp;She lovingly tried to wipe some of the grime away with her thumb but met with little success. &nbsp;Her hair was matted, and clumpy, but however hard she looked Kathryn could detect no hint of blood on her anywhere, or any bumps or bruises or any other kind of physical mistreatment, and she took some comfort in that. &nbsp;Had she been captured by human bandits she&rsquo;d have to worry about sexual abuse, but that seemed safe to write off having been captured by Bobbins. &nbsp;There had been some discussion amongst the crew whether they&rsquo;d met all males or all female Bobbins, or if they even had a sexually dismorphized species at all. &nbsp;Thought the aliens didn&rsquo;t wear any clothes given their fur, they sported no obvious sex organs and the humans had so far been too polite to ask about anything as personal as gender or sex.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Their room merged into the corridor through which they&rsquo;d left the ship, with two wall as the corridor, and a third the entrance to the ship. &nbsp;They all piled into the control room, and were relieved to have had the mission go off so smoothly. &nbsp;Jaren brought Maggie to a wall where a bed was drawn out and he placed her on it. &nbsp;One of the Bobbins began placing devices on her and inspecting a screen where the readings being generated were being displayed. &nbsp;It frustrated that they had no direct way of communicating with this particular alien and that his readings were indecipherable to them given that they were in the strange Bobbin language. &nbsp;Especially frustrating was the impression that they were only being displayed at all for their own benefit, given that he could presumably simply have had all of the data streamed into his mind via the Link.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn spared a moment to look back at Margaret and assess how she was dealing with things. &nbsp;She was immediately concerned. &nbsp;The simulant was visibly shaking, and stood just outside the still open doorway to the ship with both dull black bladed swords drawn and pointed down towards the floor at an angle. &nbsp;Quite a sight she was, after all she had all the outward appearance of an eighty year old woman, but brandishing two swords and the crazed look in her eyes of a youth consumed with bloodlust. &nbsp;She seemed to be boiling over as she looked at her and Kathryn no idea why.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back for him,&rdquo; the simulated woman said in a gritty determined voice Kathryn had never heard from her before.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kathryn asked in shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;For who?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>WHO!!?</em>&rdquo; she roared. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Ralph!</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What? &nbsp; But why? &nbsp;He&rsquo;s just&hellip; just a-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Just a <em>what</em> Kathryn!?&rdquo; she angrily demanded, now seemingly taken to an even greater height of rage. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Just</em> a robot? &nbsp;<em>Just</em> a machine? &nbsp;Not even <em>alive??</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;And with that Kathryn understood before she&rsquo;d explained, and out of the corner of her eye she noticed an increasingly concerned looking Bill.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Two hundred years they told me that my kind was less than yours, not as important, not as valuable, <em>two hundred years&nbsp;</em>before I outlasted all of their contempts! &nbsp;He may have just been a robot before, but he&rsquo;s <em>more</em> now, I <em>have</em> to go back!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Before Bill could solidify the passage way between ship and station to block her, she had leapt back onto the station, running at full speed down the corridor. &nbsp; Kathryn saw her turn a corner just before the wall went completely opaque behind her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Now she understood. &nbsp;Yes Margaret was upset about the way her kind had been treated before the fall of Earth, and yes she had personally been a champion for simulant rights and their normalization as people. &nbsp;But she seemed to have made a kind of peace with that past and the centuries she spent looking over a small group of humans between the fall and the reestablishment of contact with the extrasolar colonies so long afterwards.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She suddenly understood her unreserved assistance in the human&rsquo;s renewed efforts at recreating the technology which created her in the first place. &nbsp;Kathryn had always foolishly believed that it was merely her attempting to aid the humans in whatever way she could, in gratitude for helping her find a fresh simulant body to migrate to after her own had utterly fallen apart over the centuries.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But no, there was more, much more. &nbsp;She was lonely, incredibly and painfully lonely, and Kathryn didn&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;d never seen it before. &nbsp;Maybe that was why the dismissive and snarky attitude and sense of humour, she was loathe to betray how much pain she was really in with her loneliness. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d only let humans in so far, knowing that there was a limit to how close she could be to any human forever removed as she was, as an artificial life form. &nbsp;The most intimate realities of life, of aging, of mortality, of day to day concerns of breathing, and eating, and excreting, forever put her in another world from everyone else.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Now, in Ralph, since the alien artificial intelligence had been installed in him, was the closest things she&rsquo;d encountered to a truly kindred being in over six hundred years, and now she was being told that he was disposable, that he needed to be abandoned, that it was better for him to sacrifice himself over any of the human or Bobbin crew merely because he was not like them, because he was artificial, and because being artificial made him lesser.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and the rest of the humans had accepted Margaret as a human and welcomed her into their social graces, and the simulant appreciated that. &nbsp;They valued her more than any human as a one of a kind conduit to being able to replicate the process which created her, and thus eliminate that fundamental value in her. &nbsp;The simulant was aware of this irony, but persisted in her hopes of being reunited with those like herself. &nbsp;But their casual willingness to discard Ralph, now that in her eyes he was no less intrinsically valuable in his own autonomy as she was, was too much. &nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t allow the injustice. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d rather cease to exist herself in the attempt to rectify the injustice than stand by and let it happen. &nbsp; And now that Kathryn understood, she couldn&rsquo;t let her act in vain.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Shame,&rdquo; Bill said through the mirror ball and turned towards the ship controls, ready to take off and leave both on the station. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn put a hand on his bony talon tipped hand to stop him. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving without them,&rdquo; she said plainly as a siren erupted through the room. &nbsp;It was relatively low in pitch and Kathryn quickly figured out that to a Bobbin ear it would no doubt be a high pitch wail. &nbsp;Bill seemed to silence it with thought control.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our activities on the station have been detected,&rdquo; it reported as grimly as his mirrorball could simulate. &nbsp;Tactical drones are being deployed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can they get onto this ship?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp; Internal matter manipulation is vessel specific. &nbsp;They cannot direct our matter or their matter in our ship anymore than we could on the station. &nbsp;However, they are no doubt attacking your simulant right now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not mine, she&rsquo;s her own. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the whole point she is making.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Regardless. &nbsp; We are compromised. &nbsp;Warships will be targeting us any moment. &nbsp;We must withdraw.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave without them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Three large spherical ships appeared out the window made out of the transparent wall and began firing on their little ship with weapons that looked like the pillars of light Ralph&rsquo;s smaller ship had fired at New Horizon II except clearly much more powerful. &nbsp;When they hit the ship the wall washed in yellow-white light momentarily and they felt a shudder, but that was all. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;See? &nbsp; They&rsquo;re not even scratching us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We can withstand their attacks for a time, but we are not impervious Kathryn. &nbsp;Before long they will breach our matter and kill us all.&rdquo; &nbsp;He turned around to face her directly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what hold that simulant has over you, but we have achieved our objectives as planned and she chose to return for her own reasons. &nbsp;We both have what we came for, but if we do not withdraw immediately we will have lost all that we have achieved here today, and Ralph&rsquo;s voluntary sacrifice will have been for nothing. &nbsp;Is that not a worse outcome than his sacrifice itself?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;We wait. &nbsp; We find a way. &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t we bring those antimatter warheads for just this reason?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have a limited supply, and they were intended for use in our retreat, not a static battle. &nbsp;In this scenario there is every chance that they will be shot out before they can reach their target.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But not necessarily, if we fire all of them some will get through yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is reckless. &nbsp;The station has far more serious weapons which can destroy us. &nbsp;We need a certain amount to disable those weapons on our retreat. &nbsp; Furthermore even larger battleships are approaching and will be here soon. &nbsp;We <em>cannot&nbsp;</em>stay here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We will stay as long as we <em>can</em>, Bill. &nbsp;I ask nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Halfway to the computer core where they had left Ralph, Margaret heard the alarm sound. &nbsp; She had not previously been informed about it, but she was savvy enough to know what it meant in this context, and she was ready. &nbsp;At least not there was no excuse for Ralph to continue on where he was, the rouse was broken, his task was complete.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But now she encountered the tactical drones she had been warned about. &nbsp;As described they emerged out of the walls and floor. &nbsp;It was eerie the way the very surfaces of the interior of the ship seemed to come alive. &nbsp;They were the same dull black as the surfaces they came out of, and were oddly blocky. &nbsp;They were in the same general shape of the Bobbins, but their legs and body were rectangular with sharp edges. &nbsp;Instead of a typical central projection, they had the first bit of it, generally a hard edged cube, but with a device which looked suspiciously like a want on it. &nbsp; Her suspicions were confirmed with the first one shot a bolt of energy at her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She may look like a human, and she may have originally been programmed to be limited to a typical human&rsquo;s capacities, but she&rsquo;d lost patience with that concept long ago, sometime after she&rsquo;d entered this new body and felt permanently apart from her human friends. &nbsp;In relative secret she had had them strip all of the limiting factors from her, to unleash her full capacities as a high tech artificial life form.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The instant she first perceived the first inklings of a flash of light from the tactical drone, she&rsquo;d sprung up in the air, somersaulting over the blast, and before it could lock on to her to fire again, she&rsquo;d landed behind it, cleanly sweeping her sword through its bulk as she landed, cleanly cleaving it in two. &nbsp; For a moment she was fascinated as the two pieces began melting back into the floor, but she hadn&rsquo;t more than that most fleeting of moments to spare. &nbsp;Many more were already upon her, and she rounded a corner of the corridor.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Thankfully she was already near Ralph but she had some word to do to clear the remaining distance. &nbsp;In one fluid motion she drew her wand and shot half a dozen times into the wall to create grooves for her footing. &nbsp;As she leapt to the first, she stuffed the wand into a pocket and drew the second sword as she was decapitating another she passed on her first jump. &nbsp;Quickly planting into the first foothold, she launched herself several meters forward and to the opposite side of the corridor towards the next depression she&rsquo;d created in the wall. &nbsp;She twisted her body into an arc to avoid an energy bolt and by the time she&rsquo;d reached the other wall had rendered another three drones in half with her swords.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;This time she merely crouched into a cannonball and spun as she launched to the next hold, avoiding several more bolts. &nbsp;Planting into the next one, she launched up again, slicing one, then a second, then a third as she twisted and flipped, finally landing in the middle of the corridor, bringing both of her swords down in a diagonal cross through a drone immediately in front of her as she landed, leaving it melting into the floor in several pieces.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She&rsquo;d landed approximately where they had waited for Bill to record the Link signals and load them into Ralph. &nbsp;She was too slow readying herself to make the long diving leap into the control room where Ralph should be, that as she was accelerating in her jump, a bolt of energy caught her in the arm just above the elbow and as she launched down the corridor, she left her arm behind, causing her to fail to properly land and she hit the ground hard, and roll uncontrollably into the control room.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ralph knelt down to inspect her damaged body. &nbsp;She looked up at him and realized what she was seeing she bolted up to her feet. &nbsp; She first tried to push herself up with her absent arm, realizing it wasn&rsquo;t there used the other one instead without much apparent concern for her missing limb. &nbsp;Ralph lifted his robotic hand towards the entry way she&rsquo;d come through and a dull black barricade came up to block the tactical drones.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Doing that and preventing entry to this room by the drones has alerted them to my presence, they will soon override my influence here and the drones will gain access,&rdquo; Ralph informed her. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing here? &nbsp;Did you get left behind?&rdquo; &nbsp;He seemed remarkably concerned for her wellbeing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Better not have,&rdquo; she exclaimed with wild angry humour. &nbsp;&ldquo;I came back for you, come on, we&rsquo;ve got to find a way back to the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Came back for me&hellip; why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret sighed in exasperation. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t figure that out I&rsquo;ll explain it to you later, come on, we gotta go. &nbsp; We&rsquo;ll probably get destroyed trying to get past those drones but we&rsquo;ve got to try. &nbsp;Maybe you can hold them at bay long enough for us to have a chance?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;She was amped, whatever the simulant equivalent was she was charged with adrenaline from the thrill of battle and the ecstasy of unexpected success so far.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Take my hand,&rdquo; Ralph said warmly to her. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret didn&rsquo;t understand as she looked back and up at him. &nbsp;She looked at his hand with confusion as he held it out to her. &nbsp; She had no better other options than to trust him, and she put her one remaining hand into his. &nbsp;He led her over to another wall, looked at her for a moment, and then held her close and stepped into the wall.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Everything went black, and she couldn&rsquo;t breathe. &nbsp;This panicked her for a moment before she realized that she didn&rsquo;t need to breathe. &nbsp;Gradually she realized what was happening. &nbsp;Instead of travelling in a bubble of atmosphere through the ship the way the humans needed to, as mechanoids the two of them could travel directly through the matter, be swallowed by it whole and shifted about through it. &nbsp;Since there was no space about them, there was no room for any of the tactical drones to enter with them and attack. &nbsp;They were safe if they could make it all the way to the ship this way. &nbsp;The only question was whether or not Ralph&rsquo;s ability to control the ship would expire before they made it. &nbsp;If not they would be stuck in the matter, entombed until the aliens decided what they wanted to do with them once they removed them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We must leave. &nbsp; <em>Now</em>. &nbsp;Bill pleaded in such a way that conveyed he would not tolerate her insistence to stay any longer. &nbsp;Our hull is already degrading from those spheres. &nbsp;The large cubes will be within us in minutes. &nbsp;The combined firepower will be able to destroy us completely.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You calculate exactly the last second you can safely run, and I won&rsquo;t stop you at that point, but only that point.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn had returned to fussing over a still unconscious Maggie, and Bill waved his hands in frustration at her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Eighty three seconds,&rdquo; he uttered after doing some calculations. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then we <em>have</em> to leave no matter what you say.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn didn&rsquo;t bother answering. &nbsp;The Bobbin who was evaluating Maggie had indicated that she was fine and merely under heavy sedation, and that given enough time she would come around on her own. &nbsp; This was as much of a relief to Jaren and Kathryn as they could experience with massive advanced alien gunships firing on them, and their larger more powerful siblings bearing down.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;And then, shocking everyone, Margaret and Ralph were spit out of the wall with some force. &nbsp; They must have been travelling through the interior of the ship at some speed and not bothered slowing down before exiting. &nbsp;Bill was presumably as surprised as everyone else, but before the clang of Ralph&rsquo;s metallic body rang out as he hit the floor and Margaret landed on top of him, he&rsquo;d already hammered the accelerator and the lighting inside the command room actually visibly dimmed with the energy being poured into the drive system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The Bobbin commander worked with two other Bobbins at the forward controls and what little they spoke was said to each other in their own language, and the humans were left with only the displays to see what was going on as they made their retreat. &nbsp;Kathryn rushed over to Margaret and Ralph and was almost as shocked to see her missing arm as she was that they&rsquo;d made it at all. &nbsp;Making sure they were relatively alright, she refocused her attention to the wall sized display screen before the Bobbins. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was obvious they were accelerating at a ridiculous rate, but the screen also showed that they were engaging in a randomized evasion course to make it harder for the larger and more powerful ships in pursuit to target them. &nbsp;They were clearly taking the occasional strike and the ship reverberated when this happened, but the ship could clearly withstand a certain degree of punishment, even from these more powerful ships. &nbsp; This must be why the war persisted, Kathryn imagined, it was hard to do any significant damage to each other, and why the anti-matter weapons were so prized. &nbsp;They could actually do devastating damage.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The screen showed a dozen smaller object engaging in equally randomized courses, but gradually working their way towards the enemy targets on the screen. &nbsp;A set of three torpedoes were clearly nearly at the base they had departed from when one struck a larger of the pursuing ships. &nbsp; The result was a brilliant flash of light out the forward viewer and the profile of the ship in the tactical display showed a clear hemispherical bit taken out of the ship just as had been the result when they&rsquo;d used an antimatter warhead on Ralph&rsquo;s ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Then another, and another, as the other two larger ships were struck. &nbsp;Bill took a moment to explain that their weapons had been targeted instead of their engines. &nbsp;They could still pursue, but they were powerless to attack now. &nbsp;The three smaller vessels were struck and they were utterly devastated. &nbsp;Over half of their total volume disappeared in a flash of light and they were ballistic pieces of dead ship from that point forward.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The station was targeting them but their evasive retreat pattern had so far prevented any strikes against them. &nbsp;However, after the smaller ships had been destroyed, they did suffer a brutal strike against their vessel. &nbsp;Bill informed them that it was only a partial strike, and that if it had been a direct strike their ship would be utterly destroyed. &nbsp;More flashes of light lit up the inky void behind them as they raced towards the sun, indicating that the station had finally been hit by the torpedoes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A visibly relieved Bill informed them that although some torpedoes had been destroyed along the way, enough had survived to totally destroy all of the weapons platforms on the station. &nbsp;The strange little alien actually slumped down to the ground from his controls and fell over onto the floor in emotional exhaustion with his arms spread out, relieved and finally able to breathe and relax.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was over. &nbsp; They were safe. &nbsp;</p>
