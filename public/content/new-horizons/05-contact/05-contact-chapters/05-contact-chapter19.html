            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The group watched on a display panel beside the airlock as the ship about two thirds the size of theirs approached. &nbsp;The ship actually appeared to change the shape of the leading point of the tetrahedron, and Ralph explained that it was in fact doing just that to accommodate the different airlock of the New Horizon II. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So they can just reconfigure the shape and structure of their ships on the fly?&rdquo; Felix asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s&hellip; something,&rdquo; Felix responded. &nbsp;Like the others he was newly uncomfortable coming to grips with how fantastically beyond themselves these aliens were technologically. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess if you can make your ship any shape you want on the fly it makes as much sense to leave their ordinary state platonic solids as anything else.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; Kathryn said as the ship made its final approach. &nbsp;Even the gentlest docking ordinarily produced a noticeable shudder as the two ships forcefully made contact. &nbsp;They kept waiting for it, but at some point they realized that the ship was docked despite no such final contact being felt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They are taking control of the airlock system on your ship,&rdquo; Ralph informed them. &nbsp; &ldquo;Once they are certain they are in control they will enter the airlock.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few moments later, through the window on the circular airlock door, they saw the hull of the alien ship melt away where it was inside the airlock. &nbsp;It almost seemed to pixelate away. &nbsp;Kathryn was reminded of pointillism art she had seen in the original New Horizon archives. &nbsp;It looked like one of those where starting in the centre individual dots were stripped away and increasingly out to the periphery until there was no surface left.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the aliens came through, Kathryn marvelled at how small they were, so much smaller than she had expected. &nbsp;The very top of what she assumed was their head was no more than half a meter tall, and the total width of their leg span up and walking as they were was no wider. &nbsp; Three total came through, and when they were all in the airlock the New Horizon II side rolled away to reveal them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The three stood there equidistant from each other, just as Ralph had described and shown them. &nbsp;Seeing them in life was something else entirely. &nbsp;Kathryn had to fight away a vague sense of horror deep in her primitive brain which was instinctively disturbed by seeing something so clearly alien, so unavoidably unknown and foreign. &nbsp;Between the three was a floating silver ball thirty centimeters wide, perfectly spherical and seemingly perfectly reflective. &nbsp;She wondered what it was for but she didn&rsquo;t have to wait long to find out.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hello, my name is-&rdquo; Kathryn tried to say to introduce herself before she was cut off.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>We will inspect your ship to confirm that your arrival here is not a rouse orchestrated by our enemy</em>.&rdquo; the mirror ball said. &nbsp; Kathryn now understood. &nbsp;For some reason they were unwilling or unable to speak directly to her, so they spoke through this device. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Please stand aside and instruct your crew to do the same</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t about to press the issue of having a thousand questions. &nbsp;Instead she touched the wall panel and opened a ship wide broadcast. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is Captain Barnes. &nbsp;We have guests onboard who are going to inspect the ship. &nbsp;Make no attempt to stop, obstruct, or question them, do not interact with them in any way. &nbsp;Get out of the way and let them work in peace.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The lead alien, or at least the one at the head of the triangle, seemed to look at her in acknowledgement with his nearest deep black eye, but it was impossible to tell. &nbsp; The aliens continued on and everyone did their best to get out of the way. &nbsp;They had to fall in a line to make their way down the hallway, being splayed out quadrupeds they occupied a lot more sideways real estate than the bipedal crew did.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do we follow them?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Phbbt,&rdquo; Margaret uttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>I</em> am!&rdquo; &nbsp;She declared as she left to follow behind them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret turned to those left. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren I want you on the bridge, Felix in engineering, just in case. &nbsp;Ralph you and I are going to go keep Molly out of trouble.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The two men seemed disappointed, but they headed in the opposite direction towards a lift tube together. &nbsp;The Ralph robot followed Kathryn as she hustled a bit to catch up with Margaret. &nbsp; When they did she tugged on her shirt. &nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep our distance alright?&rdquo; &nbsp; The simulated woman seemed disappointed, but she obeyed. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The three followed along as the aliens made a complete survey of the ship, touring every conceivable room, corridor, and emergency access. &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t appear to be doing any scanning themselves, but it didn&rsquo;t take Kathryn long to realize that this was another purpose of their mirror ball. &nbsp;When they entered a news space, the device flew in and around the entire area. &nbsp;It betrayed no lights, sounds or other indication that it was doing anything other than flying around, and in that itself it seemed to move as though by magic.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Where sections had been sealed off due to hull damage, the aliens held back beyond a further airtight bulkhead and sent the drone in to investigate the evacuated section on its own. &nbsp;There were a number of awkward moments where they were waiting for it to return, with Kathryn and Margaret staring at the aliens in dumbstruck curiosity while self-consciously trying not to stare in what might be construed in a rude way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They seemed to pay particular attention to the Artificial Intelligence computer core which was powering Ralph. &nbsp;They studied and investigated where it was plugged into the central network more carefully and studiously than anything else on the ship. &nbsp;After scrutinizing every square centimeter of the ship, they returned to the airlock where they had first seen them. &nbsp;Finally they addressed Kathryn again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>We are satisfied that the narrative you conveyed was truthful and accurate</em>.&rdquo; The creatures said through the mirror ball.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s big of you,&rdquo; Margaret remarked dryly. &nbsp;Kathryn shot daggers into her eyes with her own, silently ordering her to shut her mouth.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Kathryn said as diplomatically as possible. &nbsp;&ldquo;We hope that our people can-&rdquo; &nbsp;Again she was cut off.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>We are not the appropriate personnel to initiate proper first contact greeting. &nbsp;Should you wish, you are advised to make best comfortable speed to the third planet and enter orbit. &nbsp;If you choose to do so you will be greeted by a formal welcoming party including individuals who will be happy to answer any questions you may have. &nbsp;Should you decline we recommend leaving the area as the potential for hostiles to emerge from the portal is ever-present. &nbsp;Thank you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It seemed so much like a prepared statement that as they walked back into the airlock and closed the New Horizon II door to it, she wondered if the exact wording had been forwarded from the planet, that maybe they were not allowed to say anything to them that was not an official statement issued to them. &nbsp;Her and Margaret watched as they made their way into their ship and the hull of it re-pixelated into existence behind them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As she lit a cigar, Margaret said through the corner of her mouth beside it, &ldquo;well, that was interesting.&rdquo; &nbsp;She put her lighter away and puffed the cigar up to a good burn on the tip, the smoke from it immediately disappearing into a ventilation grate.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Dammit Molly&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn said as she turned and leaned back hard against the airlock. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know you think you&rsquo;re funny and all, but if you keep it up I&rsquo;m going to have to consider it too dangerous to have you around at times like these. &nbsp;This is as serious as things get Molly, you can&rsquo;t be taking chances just to crack jokes.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn was utterly emotionally drained from having the aliens onboard. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t expected it to be such a burden on her, not just the potential risk to her ship and crew, but the prolonged time of walking on eggshells with the future relationship of her species and the first other advanced one they&rsquo;d ever met. &nbsp;The weight of things was starting to get to her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; Margaret, &ldquo;but what if it&rsquo;s <em>really</em> funny?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They may have learned our language in about two seconds, but they&rsquo;ll our humour will be the last thing they come to understand about us if they ever do, understand?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I do Kat, I do&hellip; but don&rsquo;t you already get the sense that they look down on us, that they consider us so beneath them they aren&rsquo;t even capable of being offended by lowers such as us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She hadn&rsquo;t gotten that feeling, but now that it was pointed out she did understand what she meant.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip; aren&rsquo;t they in that position?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;She gestured generally about them with her hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;Given everything?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Margaret admitted, &ldquo;but I still don&rsquo;t like it. &nbsp;Look, I&rsquo;ll play nice if the alternative is not being played at all. &nbsp; Sir, yes sir.&rdquo; &nbsp;The simulant stood at mock attention and gave a sarcastic salute. &nbsp; Kathryn knew she heard her and accepted what she said, but had to save face somewhat with an overt display of rebellion.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Using the panel beside the airlock, Kathryn closed the outer door, then opened a channel to the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren they&rsquo;ve left&hellip; obviously. &nbsp;They said they believe our story and that if we want to make proper diplomatic first contact to head for the third planet, otherwise they advise leaving the area as a potential warzone. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how they expect us to leave or what the area consists of, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She closed the channel momentarily. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph please forward a navigation map of this system to the pilot&rsquo;s station.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The channel was opened again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ralph is sending up a map, have the pilot make for the planet at one and a half gees.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; he answered through the speaker, then a few moments later. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take us a little over fifty hours to put us in orbit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be up shortly.&rdquo; &nbsp;She assured him and then closed the channel.</p>
