            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Two weeks later, Kathryn commanded the control centre as New Horizon approached the station. &nbsp; She had never seen it before, though she was quite familiar with it. &nbsp;It was only a couple years old, and advanced as it was, it had yet to be brought to the Terran system for any survey missions. &nbsp;Several were slated, specifically to explore the ruins of old human outposts elsewhere in the system, but so far its missions had only brought it to locations in the other systems.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She was familiar with its design, but she was still quite impressed at the sight of it. &nbsp; While the design of Orbital One and the original New Horizon were that of bicycle wheel about a narrow central cylinder, New Horizon II was much bulkier about the central section and just two rotating wings in the centre of the ship. &nbsp;On the former, the wheel was the central living and work section where gravity was, while the central zero gravity section was merely the engineering section. &nbsp;This was the design for a vessel or station designed for long term habitation, but New Horizon II was instead built for missions of only a few months. &nbsp;People slept and could relax in the gravity inducing rotating section, but tended to spend most of their word day down in the larger central section where all the equipment, weapons, instruments, fuel, and engines were located.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The closer it got to one of the three long and slender prongs extending from Orbital One&rsquo;s central docking section, the better look she was able to get at it. &nbsp;It consisted essentially of three modules, one behind another. &nbsp;The first in the front was the general shape of a rounded off rectangular prism with dishes, telescopes and all manner of other instruments on every surface save the one connecting it to the middle section. &nbsp;This was the business end of the research nature of the ship, able to take measurements, readings, and observations in most directions without reorienting the ship. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The middle section was somewhat narrower in its central part, but on opposite sides of the ship were four segments which looked rather like squashed oval shaped stacked on top of each other. &nbsp;The two continuously revolved around the central core, and each segment further out from the ship had increasing gravity to the point where the outermost section had approximately the same degree of simulated gravity as the surface of any of their native worlds. &nbsp;The lower gravity sections were useful for leisure in some cases, but mostly for storage of heavy items which would have been problematic to move around in the higher gravity or too dangerous to have bumping around in a total absence of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The rear section was all business. &nbsp;It was of the same general shape of the forward section, but its surface was smoother with the absence of instrumentation. &nbsp;At the rear were six antimatter engine reaction bells in two rows of three. &nbsp;Most of the rear section was storage of fuel and atmospheric control systems, as well as a laser turret on all four surfaces, and currently closed missile ports. &nbsp; The weapons systems had never been used other than in field tests and training exercises and were expected to never need to be, but the ship was designed to explore totally alien star systems and they were considered precautions essentially against the unknown.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very different ship isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Kathryn remarked to Jaren with her arms crossed as she watched the ship approach the prong. &nbsp;It was lit up fairly well between its own lights falling on its exterior (including the obligatory light shining on its name painted on the side of the rear section), and Orbital One&rsquo;s own powerful docking spotlights.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Compared to the original New Horizon?&rdquo; Jaren asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sure is&hellip; no arboretum since it has Kobol atmospheric systems, the original had no weapons at all. &nbsp;New Horizon actually got up to far higher speeds than this one ever will, but the acceleration makes all the difference. &nbsp;With the antimatter engines this one accelerates wildly faster.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Orbital One, this is Captain Sirius of the New Horizon II requesting permission to dock.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn touched the glass panel in front of her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Permission granted to Pier Two as per your approach New Horizon II. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been expecting you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a fine looking ship you have there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Thank you. &nbsp;Docking Pier Two acknowledged.</em>&rdquo; was the only reply.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;All business that one, eh?&rdquo; Jaren rubbed his chin and remarked to Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Probably miffed we&rsquo;re taking over his command.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No doubt. &nbsp; I would be.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s go meet him, see if we can smooth over any ruffled feathers.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took Jaren and Kathryn some time to descend down a central spoke to the engineering section, and then pull themselves along the long docking prong used for ships too large to come right up to the central section of the station. &nbsp;Eventually they did manage to arrive in time to greet the captain. &nbsp;Like everything on the station, the docking controls were optimized for thought control, but Kathryn and the others had become quite proficient in using the comparatively clumsy touch control panels instead. &nbsp;With a few taps she normalized the air pressure and the round hatches on either side rolled to the side.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain Sirius,&rdquo; she greeted the man with a salute. &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome aboard Orbital One. &nbsp;Is this your first time on the station?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you Admiral. &nbsp;Yes it is. &nbsp; This is my XO, Commander Sengupta,&rdquo; he introduced a woman who emerged behind him, with a narrow face and short cut dark hair to match her almond coloured skin.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn shook her hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of <em>the</em> Senguptas?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; the woman answered simply.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our orders indicated that you Jaren will be commissioned to serve as the admiral&rsquo;s XO, so Sengupta will be joining me for a tour here.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Would you like to be shown around?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Absolutely. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ve studied the schematics of course, but I need to be as familiar with my new post as possible before assuming command.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Command had deemed it most efficient for Kathryn and Sirius to merely swap commands during the duration of the mission.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I appreciate your relinquishing command for this mission, I hope you understand our wish to get another mission like this under our belt,&rdquo; Kathryn offered as she and Jaren led him hand rail by hand rail the interior length of the docking prong.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We go where command says,&rdquo; he replied plainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Though if we are speaking plainly?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Kathryn granted as his superior officer.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We were all very much looking forward to the first rift ship calling back since we expected it would be us sent out on the expedition. &nbsp;You will be met by a very excited crew, and Sengupta and I are&hellip; disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You are of course entitled though given your history,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;and I am looking forward to getting to know this station during our tour here. &nbsp;After all there is every chance that in your absence we will hear back from another rift ship and be slated to explore that one when you return.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Survey missions are interesting, but this is Sengupta and I&rsquo;s first time to Earth. &nbsp;It will be stimulating to familiarize myself with all of the research being conducted here and see the planet itself. &nbsp; The more I&rsquo;ve thought about it on our way here the more I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy to hear that Captain. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll take very good care of your ship for you, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not mine,&rdquo; he answered coldly. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Star Fleet&rsquo;s, but it <em>is</em> the best in the fleet by a light year. &nbsp;My tour as captain was only for three years, extended now of course by the time your expedition takes, but it was never mine for good. &nbsp;When my time comes some other very qualified officer will have the privilege of commanding New Horizon II.&rdquo;</p>
