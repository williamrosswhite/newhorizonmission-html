            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A great short chapter I wrote and then lost. &nbsp;The one time I don&rsquo;t post it online, I lose it and it&rsquo;s unrecoverable. &nbsp; Figures. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll rewrite in the future when the loss isn&rsquo;t so fresh and painful. &nbsp;It started with a page about Kathryn going to her daughter&rsquo;s quarters and rifling through her stuff, remarking how she&rsquo;d brought so many more games and media in her drive than she&rsquo;d ever have the chance to play and consume because she was like that. &nbsp;She broke down crying, finally surrendering in private to the weight of her loss and everything that happened, but then toughened up, undid her mangled hair and put it up again cleanly in the bathroom mirror, including a comment about how much gray there was in her hair now. &nbsp;She then went to the bridge and relieved Jaren to presumably go do the same. &nbsp; Also a comment that they were doing lazy three quarter gee alternating accelerations and decelerations in their orbit to have some gravity while they hung out around the planet. &nbsp;Around the time Jaren came back so did Margaret, informing them that the crew view both alternatives as probable death, but the planet option was a pointless drawn out death while the attempted rescue mission at least had a slim prospect for glorious success. &nbsp;They were all out here cuz they&rsquo;re adventurous so to a crewmember they were all in. &nbsp;Kathryn has a conversation with Ralph over comms cementing their arrangement, and having him explicitly state that he has no contingency orders if they go where he wants to and is still unable to report in. &nbsp;Kathryn gives a macabre speech to the crew that they are headed into the capital system of god level technology aliens of unknown intentions on the faint hope that they can successfully make first contact properly, rescue their daughter, and be returned home heroes. &nbsp;Jaren says some speech, Kathryn shrugs.<br>&nbsp;</p>
