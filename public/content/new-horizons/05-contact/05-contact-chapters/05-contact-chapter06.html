            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As per it&rsquo;s programming, the rift drone ship finding itself in a binary star system, created the rift around the star around which the planet most like Earth orbited, Cygni 61 A, which also happened to be the more luminous star. &nbsp;Both being K type stars, their luminosities and temperatures were somewhere between that of an M type red dwarf and Earth&rsquo;s own G type yellowish white star. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The as of yet unnamed planet other than the unremarkable classification designation of Cygni 61 Aa, orbited the star at a little less than half the distance Earth orbited the sun, though like Earth this varied somewhat as it went about its elliptical orbit. &nbsp;As expected it likewise seemed to take a little less than half of an Earth year to complete an orbit around the star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Naturally enough, this planet was their first target. &nbsp;Not only was it the closest one to the system&rsquo;s rift gate, but it was also the most intriguing. &nbsp;It was in all respects an analogue for Earth, Haven, Kobol, and Roma with one exception; the apparent total lack of any signs of life. &nbsp;The primary interest for them was to study whether or not there was some factor which inhibited the development of cellular life on this body, or if it serendipitously had simply never happened. &nbsp;Answering this question would be very relevant in their predictions and models for how common it was for cellular life to develop in the cosmos given ideal conditions.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they approached on their four day climb out of the gravity well of the star, they endured far more frequent and lengthy burn phases since now they were fighting gravity instead of working with it. &nbsp;During this time though, their forward observation array was intensely probing and analyzing the planet in question. &nbsp;Now that there was a torrent of data to analyze, there was no trouble finding plenty of work for young Maggie to do and learn from, and Margaret herself was now more fully getting into the action, crunching and analyzing more data than any other crew member if only for her absence of need for sleep.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;During this though, the lateral instrument arrays where possible were scanning all of the other bodies in the system at the same time, and there were plenty to study. &nbsp; These surveys were more preparatory for the following phase of the mission when they were finished with the first planet. &nbsp;It was important to designate a hierarchy of targets, to later plot a course which could take them to the most interesting targets in the system since it would be impossible to see everything there was to see during the first mission to the system.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;On the fourth day though, they arrived at the planet, and entered a standard low orbit. &nbsp; It was remarkable how much this planet seemed like the models of early Earth before life happened. &nbsp;And yet, given the long life of stars like these compared to Earth&rsquo;s sun, this planet presumably had a billion and a half more years to get there yet for some reason never did. &nbsp;There was speculation that maybe it had gotten started but some calamity wiped it out, or maybe life had initiated several times and the same mysterious doomsday wiped the planetary slate clean over and over. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But always present was the eerie and oddly difficult to believe probability that it just never happened, that life is not a given even with ideal conditions, that it is even more precious and tenuous than they&rsquo;d ever imagined. &nbsp;There were long talks into the night amongst the crew about the possibility that finding their four home planets in close proximity as they had might have been a remarkable cosmic coincidence. &nbsp;Every decrease in the projected occurrence of cellular life, decreased the probability of plant, animal, and intelligence in turn logarithmically.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They spent a couple more days orbiting and studying the strong and accommodating magnetic field, the toxic stew of the atmosphere resulting from unprocessed ancient and to a small degree still occurring volcanic eruptions and emissions, and the remarkably appropriate atmospheric pressure before making their next more.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want to go down there,&rdquo; Kathryn finally resolved. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t really in our mission profile,&rdquo; Jaren reminded her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s not specifically excluded. &nbsp;The onboard shuttle is perfectly capable and we&rsquo;d only need sealed environmental suits down there. &nbsp;I want to go, personally.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren smiled and shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the admiral, Admiral. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to pick a team, and you&rsquo;ll have a full of volunteers who will be disappointed not to be chosen. &nbsp;Shuttle only holds four comfortably, six uncomfortably.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take six. &nbsp;This is admittedly not a science mission. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going down to plant the flag and name it, for the thrill of being the first and nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Un hunh, and exactly what flag do you intend to plant?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hunh. &nbsp; You&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that&hellip; &nbsp;I supposed I figured the Haven flag but that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate would it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nor permissible according to the Star Fleet charter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well there you go, we&rsquo;ll use the Star Fleet flag we have hanging in engineering. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s kind of big to be used that way, but&hellip; we&rsquo;ll figure something out.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren nodded that this was a perfectly appropriate idea.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to balance the first team too&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;First?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;I want two of each world on the first mission to balance out the achievement. &nbsp;Then I want to make return trips for any of the crew who want to go down as well. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s make the first team just be the most senior personnel from each world, alright? &nbsp; That seems fair.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It also puts both of us on the first mission.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, does it?&rdquo; Kathryn asked with comically feigned innocence.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A few hours later, six crew members were shoehorned into the cramped shuttle, made all the more uncomfortable by the environmental suits they were wearing. &nbsp; They were essentially form fitting, but being loose enough to make movement easy also made getting in each other&rsquo;s way easy. &nbsp;The shuttle was saucer shaped, with a bench around the interior perimeter for them to sit on. &nbsp;Like the bridge, all of the surfaces were display screens which displayed the exterior. &nbsp; This included the central pillar in which the anti-matter engine hardware was located. &nbsp;One hardly noticed it was there with how well it blended its own display with that of the further distant wall.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There were restraint harnesses for six, but as Jaren suggested, it was not for comfort. &nbsp; Really standard use was for four occupants, and six in a lifeboat capacity if necessary, but it was not out of bounds to use it this way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret had wanted to come, but hadn&rsquo;t been terribly insistent about being on the first trip, though she certainly had a solid case to make as the only real representative of Earth itself onboard. &nbsp;She had relented though. &nbsp;She was curious, but not as all consumed by her curiosity as the other seemed to be.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Onboard were Kathryn and Felix representing Haven, Jaren and the Kobolian Chief Engineer who&rsquo;s position had been usurped by Felix but which he&rsquo;d only taken formally, leaving her to her expertise in the position. &nbsp;The Roma representatives were Clementine, the female Roman communications officer more commonly referred to as Clem, and Benedict, the male senior science officer more commonly referred to as Ben. &nbsp;All six uncomfortably squeezed into the shuttle for the twenty minutes or so their descent would take. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Under Jaren&rsquo;s direction, the shuttle disengaged from the rear section of the ship, and with a slight burn to slow their orbital velocity, then tightly closed its engine exhaust port to present an ablative shallow umbrella surface to the atmosphere. &nbsp; It looked remarkably like the descent capsules from the earliest days of Terran spaceflight, but it was nowhere near as fragile or unsophisticated as those fragile early crafts. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It took a little less than twenty minutes for a violent inferno beneath their feet from atmospheric friction to slow them to mere terminal velocity in the planet&rsquo;s healthy thick atmosphere. &nbsp;The central engine port then opened again, and pushed the shuttle up in to a stable hover over the landscape. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The planet&rsquo;s surface was covered a little more than half with ocean (must ret-con this fact as well as there being methane in the atmosphere as well as where specifically the shuttle is in the structure of the larger ship), and they had selected a site near the equator by the ocean, hoping to find something like the tidal pools in which chemistry on Earth first gave rise to organic chemistry crudely discovering a way to replicate itself, after which ever more complex evolution became all but inevitable.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren flew the shuttle over to the area discussed, then slowly brought the shuttle down for a descent. &nbsp;The crew was silent as the studied the images projected on the walls about them. &nbsp;The utter otherworldliness of this place was humbling, and yet there was something indescribably familiar about it, like looking into one&rsquo;s deep, deep ancestral past, before any ancestors of anything existed. &nbsp; It was total and utter primordium, and it chilled something very deep within them to witness it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As the shuttle neared the ground and slowed down further, three spindly landing struts opened long narrow ports under the shuttle and extended, unfolding to double their lengths, and then finally rested softly against the ground before the joints in the struts bent slightly to accommodate the weight of the craft.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Touchdown,&rdquo; Jaren offered somberly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Everyone ready?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Double check your suit integrity.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The rest of the crew checked the panel on the inside of their wrists and reported that they were indeed ready.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay Jaren, lower the door.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was a soft hiss as the very different atmospheres in and out of the shuttle quickly intermingled and exchanged. &nbsp;One part of the wall broke away, swinging up from the half way point, and down below it. &nbsp; After the lower part fell to a forty-five degree angle, an internal extension slipped out from within, lengthening the ramp and extending all the way to the ground. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Everyone in the shuttle looked over at Kathryn, who took a deep breath and stood up. &nbsp; &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; she muttered to herself as she stood on the threshold before the ramp. &nbsp;Her suit was a light grey head to toe, accentuated only by the multi-function touch computer and monitoring device on her wrist, and her face piece which featured broad goggles which could facilitate an internal head up display over her actual vision, and mask over her mouth and nose to facilitate her breathing. &nbsp;Both were tightly sealed to the material of her suit, and she could feel the moderate weight of the air pack for which she carried the weight like a backpack, but which was all cleverly built into the suit.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She slowly walked down the ramp, but hesitated at the bottom of it. &nbsp;She called back to the shuttle. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren! &nbsp;Clem! &nbsp; Come down here.&rdquo; &nbsp;Somewhat confused the two obeyed and approached her down the ramp. &nbsp;&ldquo;This just doesn&rsquo;t feel right,&rdquo; she explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only here because we came together, our three worlds working together. &nbsp;It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right for me as a representative of just one of our worlds to set foot here first. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s do it together.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The others were delighted, including the three still on the shuttle who clearly quite appreciated the gesture. &nbsp;Jaren and Clem perched precariously on just their left foot on either side of Kathryn, all interlocked arms.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be easy to screw up.&rdquo; &nbsp;The other two nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp; On the count of three. &nbsp;One, two, three.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they said the words three, the trio of humans extended their right foots onto the surface of the first new world in over six hundred years. &nbsp;Kathryn smirked a little, sensing that she nonetheless had still touched her foot down to the surface first, just a hair&rsquo;s breath before the others. &nbsp;Not intentionally of course, she merely perceived it to have turned out that way since it was something of a metaphysical impossibility for them to all make contact at exactly the same time. &nbsp;What she never noticed was the same slight smirk on the others, never finding out that the others the rest of their lives also kept the secret that they had felt the exact same way.&nbsp;</p>
