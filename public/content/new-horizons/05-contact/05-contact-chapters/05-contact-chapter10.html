            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A day later, New Horizon II was on its final approach to the alien ship it had encountered. &nbsp; The two gee burn phase was over, and now the ship was refining its orbit around the sun to get ever nearer to the other ship, matching its own orbit around the sun and settling up beside it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Communications package finally ready?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Felix with ironically feigned irritation from her command chair on the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then by all means begin transmission. &nbsp;How close are we to the ship now?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Twenty kilometers,&rdquo; Jaren reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, snuggle us up pilot. &nbsp;We need to be within five. &nbsp;Anyone see anything that looks like a docking port?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The ship was conical with a series of dark bulbs completely covering its exterior from base to tip, but now it had a large spherical cleanly and uniform impression cut out of it starting at the base halfway to the centre of the base where the engine was, and halfway up to the top, and seemingly all the way down to the interior of the craft. &nbsp;It appeared as though the antimatter weapon and cut out the recess but that the annihilation which produced this effect had had zero effect on the surrounding materials. &nbsp; It was somewhat eerie how unaffected the ship seemed by the titanic explosion, how perfectly excised the section was. &nbsp;It was rotating on multiple axes at a moderate speed, fast enough that it was very noticeable, but not so fast that it prevented good lucks at every part of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Margaret answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;But to be fair we may have annihilated it if it had one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Admiral,&rdquo; Felix spoke up.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t map the interior before because the exterior scattered the beams, but I can now get some readings from the penetrating radar about the interior.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And&hellip; there isn&rsquo;t one, not really. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a narrow central section which seems designed for access, but the rest of the ship is those bulbs all the way down to the interior.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Interesting. &nbsp; So is there any interior at all which we can enter?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Scanning&hellip; yes, but barely. &nbsp;At the very centre of the ship there is a section ten meters long and a few meters wide, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And you still can&rsquo;t scan those bulbs effectively to see what they are?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hunh. &nbsp; Jaren, are you getting any readings of power or comms or anything?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No EM transmissions&hellip; the power plant whatever it is is obviously down, but I am getting some readings indicating battery power, but it&rsquo;s weak. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s enough to keep systems alive but not to run them fully I&rsquo;d guess.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no life forms aboard,&rdquo; Margaret remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not anymore,&rdquo; Felix replied.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there ever were. &nbsp;A space ten by three meters? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s engineering access at best. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an automated probe like the one we sent here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And the voice we were talking to?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;An artificial intelligence, like me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It certainly shared your people skills,&rdquo; Jaren ribbed. &nbsp;Margaret didn&rsquo;t even bother glaring at him, she was absorbed in the potential.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You still intend to board it don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Margaret asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright Felix, launch stabilizers.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Six small robotics crafts launched in quick succession out of a tube in the stern of the ship, and rocketed towards the alien ship. &nbsp;The bridge crew watched as they moved about the ship and strategically attached themselves to key points on its hull. &nbsp;They then all fired thrusters, working in concert to reduce and ultimately end the multi axis spin of the ship, and bring it to a relative stop to New Horizon II. &nbsp;They also now had the ability to nudge the ship around in space as they needed, not extensively but the drones made minor manoeuvering possible.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Pilot, bring us within grapple range, one kilometer.&rdquo; &nbsp;They all watched on the one remaining wall monitor as the ship got closer and closer, and came into greater and greater detail. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s entirely black exterior gave it a very ominous appearance as it grew larger and larger on them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Just ahead of one kilometer, retro manoeuvering rockets fired to bring them to a relative stop once again. &nbsp;&ldquo;One kilometer, Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thank you. &nbsp; Felix, fire grapples.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Four lines fired out of the New Horizon II&rsquo;s side and attached themselves in a square grid before pulling themselves taught.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bring us within transit distance.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The lines were reeled in to a distance of only one hundred meters, then soft manoeuvering jets on the New Horizon II as well as the drones attached to the alien craft put out a constant low level thrust to keep the lines between the ships taught and avoid a collision. &nbsp;They would remain in this mode until the lines were withdrawn and the New Horizon II pulled away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One hundred meters Admiral,&rdquo; Felix called out. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, Felix you&rsquo;re with me, Jaren the ship is yours.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren nodded, but Margaret balked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t seriously think <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not coming with you do you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn smirked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course not Molly, come along.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Down in the environmental suit room, Kathyn and Felix were pulling on their suits. &nbsp;They were made of a special fabric designed by the Kobolians. &nbsp;They stretched and fit pretty snugly as they were, but when a variable current was passed through the material they tightened and constricted, creating enough pressure on the skin to protect it from the vacuum of space. &nbsp;All that was then needed was the thin thermal layer which could also cool and warm the suit depending on the need. &nbsp;Compared to the bulky space ship suits Kathryn had had to use at the start of her career on Haven before they&rsquo;d met the Kobolians, it allowed an incredible freedom of movement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A fishbowl shaped transparent helmet went over the head, and attached to the suit about the shoulders by strong electromagnets creating a seal for the air in the helmet which was fed by a tank worn on the back like a backpack. &nbsp;The suits were greyish white with a slight silver sheen to them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As they pulled their suits on, first the pants, then the shirt, then the gloves and boots with variable magnets in the soles, Maggie entered the departure bay.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What are you doing here hon? &nbsp;We&rsquo;re about to leave.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I want to come with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&hellip; <em>must</em> be joking. &nbsp;We have no idea what we&rsquo;re going into over there. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s dangerous. &nbsp;No way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix and Margaret looked at each other.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to let me come all this way, be in this much danger, only to not come the rest of the way with you? &nbsp;Does that really make sense?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kid&rsquo;s got a point,&rdquo; Margaret poked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>You</em>, shut the fuck up,&rdquo; Kathryn snapped at her with a pointed finger. &nbsp;She then sighed heavily.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s really that dangerous should you even be going?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah yeah yeah, fine. &nbsp;Okay&hellip; &nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing this. &nbsp; Fine. &nbsp;Suit up. &nbsp;Oh your father is going to <em>kill</em> me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well at least I&rsquo;d still have one parent,&rdquo; Maggie offered mischievously.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Un hunh.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn touched the wall panel to open a channel to the bridge. &nbsp;&ldquo;So, Jaren&hellip; guess who has decided she&rsquo;s coming along?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren pursed his lips on the screen and then answered through gritted teeth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming <em>not</em> Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And you would be wrong,&rdquo; Kathryn answered in a somewhat dramatized game show voice while looking away, trying to soften the blow.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kathryn. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing about this mission is safe at this point Jaren. &nbsp;Safe would have been going home as soon as we saw that ship, or after the attack. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see how going over to that ship a this point is any more dangerous than staying on this one at this point. &nbsp;That was her point anyways, and I bought it. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not ecstatic about it though dear. &nbsp;We wanted to awaken her adventurous spirit, I believe we have. &nbsp; God help us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren considered for a few moments. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fine. &nbsp; Let us know when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Will do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After getting themselves suited up, Kathryn and Felix carefully helped Maggie into her suit, doubling and then triple checking all of her seals, equipment, and safety features, giving each other mildly worried looks periodically as they did. &nbsp; What they were about to do was stressful enough, and this was only adding pressure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret declined to help, and instead puffed on a cigar through her grin as she watched them suiting themselves up and twisting themselves up into knots with concern. &nbsp; As a simulant she would have been originally programmed to lose consciousness and become inactive in a vacuum to simulate a human dying in the exposure, but her spate of upgrades had clearly unburdened her of this concern. &nbsp;She also presumably didn&rsquo;t need the communications equipment of the helmets either, she could speak to them by direct thought transmission to their helmet speakers, and receive their comms to her through the same link in her head. &nbsp; As she blew the smoke out of her mouth while silently mocking their human frailty the smoke immediately disappeared into one of the environmental vents.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As confident as she could be about the proper workings of her daughter&rsquo;s suit and equipment, Kathryn gave the signal to Jaren that they were clear. &nbsp;He seemed to have reached an acceptance of the situation if not a calm about it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood&hellip; I guess we need a code name.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How bout Hero?&rdquo; Kathryn offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are ostensibly here to render assistance.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Be real,&rdquo; Margaret scolded. &nbsp;&ldquo;More like Bandit&hellip; or Pirate.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn laughed but Jaren cut in with &ldquo;Hero it is.&rdquo; before anyone could take Margaret&rsquo;s suggestions too seriously. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll designate the ship &lsquo;Boss&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be One,&rdquo; Kathryn said, &ldquo;Felix Two, Molly Three, and Maggie Four.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; Proceed when ready Hero One.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You realize that&rsquo;s more syllables than your actual name right?&rdquo; Margaret scolded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Kathryn acknowledged, declining to observe her point. &nbsp;&ldquo;Entering the airlock now Jaren. &nbsp;Closing inner door and depressurizing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was a slight lag in the automatic response of the tension and temperature of the suit, so she could feel a constant sense of low pressure and cold until the atmosphere was completely reabsorbed by the ship and the automatic suits normalized to the vacuum.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Engage boots,&rdquo; she ordered her team, and they obeyed, all then slowly sinking to the floor and locking down.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Opening the outer door.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn touched the flexible control panel on her wrist contoured to her suit and the outer door opened onto the vacuum of space. &nbsp;&ldquo;Comms check everyone?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Check,&rdquo; they all said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go first, then Magie, then Felix and Molly behind. &nbsp;Clip your harness to the grapple line just outside the door, and pull yourself over to the other ship. &nbsp;Maggie you&rsquo;ve done this for fun back home but this isn&rsquo;t a game here. &nbsp;Take it seriously. &nbsp;Be methodical and cautious, understand?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Mom.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stepped to the edge of space, and reached up to clip her tether onto the grapple line. &nbsp;This one had deliberately been shot directly towards the exposed end of the central section, the only place where it made any sense for them to physically go.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She turned pushed off from the ship and held the grapple line as the bottom half of her flew gently out in front of her and was held back by her grip. &nbsp;She then slowly put one hand over the other, periodically looking back at the others as she went. &nbsp;She was quite surprised at how calm her daughter seemed to be. &nbsp;No she had never displayed an appetite for adventure in the past, but in some sense it was in her blood. &nbsp;Now that she was out here, in the thick of it, her composure impressed her mother.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Halfway across she heard Jaren call out over the comm: &ldquo;Halfway Hero One.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Acknowledged.&rdquo; &nbsp; She focused her attention on the ship they were approaching. &nbsp;They were halfway to the end of the line, but with the concave section excised from the ship they were nearly at the point at which they would be within the ship if it were still intact. &nbsp;She got a chill up her spine. &nbsp;Something didn&rsquo;t feel right but she brushed it off. &nbsp;Healthy fear of the unknown, she figured.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not nice,&rdquo; she observed as she approached the end of the line. &nbsp;What appeared to be a large monitor was smashed by the magnetic piton at the end of the grapple line, the first one over from one which was cleanly cut in half by the line which demarked existent ship, and annihilated ship. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She was amazed by the resilience of the rest of the ship. &nbsp;She reached the end of the line and touched the remaining half large monitor. &nbsp;It was cracked sure, but it had been centimeters from an antimatter explosion even less friendly than a nuclear one.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Have a look at this Felix,&rdquo; she said as she moved aside and magnetized to the floor of the small interior section. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, at least the mag boots work.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She helped Maggie to the floor where she could magnetize and Felix came next. &nbsp;&ldquo;What am I looking at?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This monitor. &nbsp; Cut clearly in half by the antimatter spread, yet the rest is intact. &nbsp;What the hell is this thing made of? &nbsp;I could understand the hull being hardened in this way but a damn display panel?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a clue&hellip;&rdquo; Felix admitted as he stepped to the ground and Margaret finally came the rest of the way and joined them. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned around and looked out the opening out into the vastness of space. &nbsp; They were on the opposite side of the sun, and New Horizon II was beautifully lit up, so bright in fact that it washed out all but the brightest stars. &nbsp;The ship still made it a stunning view and she turned her daughter around to appreciate it for a moment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what have we here&hellip;&rdquo; Felix asked as he moved further into the space.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You look a little worse for wear from here Boss, but you&rsquo;re still beautiful,&rdquo; Kathryn remarked on the obviously battered condition of the ship. &nbsp;It looked worse from out here than the description of the damage sounded from the inside. &nbsp;She found herself newly concerned about the integrity of the ship but she brushed it off. &nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proceeding inside Boss.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood Hero One.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yup, so&hellip; I think this is it,&rdquo; Felix remarked. &nbsp;They were in a cylindrical shaped area ten meters deep and three meters wide. &nbsp;Like the interior of the bridge had originally been, it appeared that the entire surface was one giant display monitor, its true segmented nature revealed at the opening only by the damage done. &nbsp;Deep inside, the entire interior appeared of smooth glass as best as they could make out from the lights mounted on their helmets.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Margaret asked as she moved to the far end of the area.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The wall end of the tube was not surfaced the same way, but had differently coloured concentric rings on it which were fractured and disjointed, not by damage but by design. &nbsp;Green curves, and blue, and yellow, and some spaces where it appeared there should be similar lines but were not.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ultraviolet,&rdquo; Margaret explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where it looks like there should be lines, there are you just can&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You can see that?&rdquo; Maggie asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Upgrades,&rdquo; Margaret answered with a mischievous smile towards the girl as she tapped at the side of her head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;In the centre of the circular wall, at the centre of the rings was a large object which projected out of the wall. &nbsp;It was two meters long, and shaped like an oval, about half a meter wide and a quarter meter high. &nbsp;It had fine linear ridges from the wall all the way to its tip which looked like very short heat sync fins.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is this&hellip;&rdquo; Maggie asked as she reached out to touch it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Kathryn called out but it was too late. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As soon as the girl touched the surface of the central projection the entire space came to life. &nbsp;The curved lines on the rear wall began flashing menacingly and the panels all about them came to life, revealing what appeared to be status and control displays, but of a configuration and language completely foreign and unrecognizable to any of them. &nbsp;An eerie blue light emanated from the recesses of the ridging along the central projection, and they flashed along with the booming voice which nearly deafened them over their comm speakers in their helmets: &ldquo;<em>INTRUDERS!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
