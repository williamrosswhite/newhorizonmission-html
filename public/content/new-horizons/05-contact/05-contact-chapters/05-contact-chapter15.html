            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The fourth planet in the system was a world not entirely unlike the planets the humans had colonized, though it was drier than the others. &nbsp;It had one large ocean that occupied a little more than a third of the planet, but the rest was land, and the further away from that ocean that land was, the drier and more unforgivingly desert the terrain was.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn stood on the bridge watching on the wall monitors the planet slip down underneath. &nbsp; She had ordered Felix to scavenge some of the other remaining wall screens throughout the ship and install them on the bridge. &nbsp;Now they had a comfortable six panel front view screen to work with. &nbsp;It was a pale shadow of the view the bridge had been built to provide, but it was certainly much better than the postage stamp by which they&rsquo;d been trying to look out from previously.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What have we got Jaren?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren continued to study his panel for several moments before answering. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at the location where Ralph claimed that base was supposed to be&hellip; but there&rsquo;s nothing there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And by nothing you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t have a telescope to look in detail but I&rsquo;m not picking up any comm traffic or anything. &nbsp;Based on the instruments we have left there&rsquo;s nothing to indicate that there is anything down there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Suggestions?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We have to go down there,&rdquo; Ralph said as the door to the lift slid open and his robot body stepped out. &nbsp;A couple days ago he had decided that his quarantine was no longer necessary and overwritten the controls which had kept him there. &nbsp;Kathryn on her inside momentarily had an utter fit, but then calmed herself. &nbsp;There was nothing she could do about it and just resigned herself to it once she&rsquo;d accepted it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why do we have to go down there?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Instruments on this ship are inadequate to determine the status of the base.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Were there any orbital facilities?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the robot answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am deeply concerned. &nbsp;There was an extensive ship yard in orbit where I was built, but there seems to be no trace of it now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hypothesis?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is no longer there,&rdquo; the robot answered plainly. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t seem to understand that she was asking an explanation as to why.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren? &nbsp; What do you think about going down?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, it concerns me obviously. &nbsp;Flying down to an alien environment with no instruments to tell us ahead of time what we&rsquo;re going to find when we get down there? &nbsp;Just tell me we&rsquo;re not bringing Maggie down there&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn actually laughed out loud, and it was nice to have her tension broken.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Besides, the shuttles&rsquo; short range sensors are intact and we can take more comprehensive data with them once we&rsquo;re closer to the facility.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn pointed at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; Okay Jaren, you, Margaret, Ralph, and I will take Shuttle One down to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren just nodded and rose from his station, walking past Ralph and exiting the bridge through the lift to go prep the shuttle.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How long ago did you leave this planet?&rdquo; she asked Ralph.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Twenty-six-point-three-years,&rdquo; the robot repeated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So whatever happened wasn&rsquo;t too long ago&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You are happy to come along on our little field trip?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I would have insisted on it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked out the view screen at the surface beneath them. &nbsp;&ldquo;This mission sure is turning out more interesting than we&rsquo;d planned. &nbsp;How could an entire orbital shipyard be destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The shuttle disengaged from the New Horizon II and whisked away at moderate acceleration in the opposite direction from which the mothership orbited. &nbsp;It had lost most of its orbital velocity by the time it hit the bulk of the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere below, and casually lowered itself down to the surface of the planet.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The immersive projection of the exterior of the shuttle onto the interior walls showed a stark environment a couple thousand kilometers in from the massive ocean. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t completely barren and dry as the opposite side of the planet was, but it was quite arid. &nbsp;It was obvious that very little of the ocean&rsquo;s moisture made it in this far.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s heavier at the surface,&rdquo; Jaren reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;One-point-four gee it looks like.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One-point-seven by your metric is the preferred gravity of the builders, the environment they originally evolved in,&rdquo; Ralph answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That would explain why their body shapes are so distinct from ours,&rdquo; Kathryn remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And yet the atmospheric composition is the same,&rdquo; Jaren remarked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not the same, but within human tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, this planet&rsquo;s atmosphere has a lower oxygen level than optimal for the founders but within tolerance. &nbsp;Inside the facility extra oxygen is added for comfort.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh hell,&rdquo; Margaret said as a clearer picture of the area they were headed towards came into view. &nbsp;There was nothing left of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The area where they were approaching, there was only a slight crater, regular in its circular shape, and quite distinct from the terrain around it. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t have the raised lip one would expect to find from a crater created by a falling rock, instead it seemed to be evenly shaved out of the bedrock. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t terribly deep, but it was clearly there nonetheless, dozens of kilometers wide cut uniformly and remarkably smoothly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; gone,&rdquo; the robot observed, seeming more shocked and concerned than she would have given him credit for displaying in his current form. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was attacked,&rdquo; he said, turning to the others. &nbsp;&ldquo;Take us down to the surface,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren looked at Kathryn and she somberly nodded towards him. &nbsp;Jaren piloted the ship down to a soft landing at the edge of the shallow crater.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As Kathryn reached for the door controls, Jaren grabbed her arm firmly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;When she looked back at him he was studying his screens with a furrowed brow. &nbsp;&ldquo;You open that door we&rsquo;re both dead. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s intense radiation out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So it was nukes&hellip;&rdquo; she marvelled.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;And higher yield than we&rsquo;ve ever been stupid enough to build at that. &nbsp;By a lot in fact.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I need to go out there,&rdquo; Ralph said. &nbsp;Kathryn could sense the note of frustration in his voice, and despite his robot form he was visibly agitated. &nbsp;New Horizon II had taken up a geostationary orbit at the equator further north from them. &nbsp; It allowed them to maintain a direct data link to keep Ralph&rsquo;s body and his core connected continuously.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well hold on,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Break out the environment,&rdquo; she ordered Jaren and Margaret.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren remained fixed on his instruments while Margaret opened a display screen panel on the floor, and started pulling out two sets of environment suits from underneath. &nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you think this happened?&rdquo; Margaret asked Ralph.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown,&rdquo; he answered plainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;The builders are at peace.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Have they always been?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Has any intelligent species always been at peace?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Margaret answered dryly as she pulled the last helmet out and stood up. &nbsp; &ldquo;Are there any other species who might have done this?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;None that we know of, none that would dare.&rdquo; &nbsp;Something in his voice when he uttered the second half of that sentence was dark, vengeful even.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As Kathryn and Jaren pulled on their environment suits, Ralph reviewed the data on the terminal Jaren had been studying. &nbsp;&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t have happened long ago. &nbsp;Based on the decay rate&hellip; only twenty-one Earth days.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any indication that whoever did this is still around?&rdquo; was the last thing Kathryn was able to ask in a normal voice before pulling on the helmet and having to use the suit to suit comm system instead.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing the ship or shuttle has picked up,&rdquo; Jaren answered in her ear. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whoever did this seems to be long gone. &nbsp;Ready?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the wall fell initially began falling away there was a rush of air as the internal and external atmosphere intermingled. &nbsp;They had already been subjected to the higher gravity, but walking down the ramp they really felt it and immediately began to feel somewhat fatigued. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ralph had exited first and immediately headed to the edge of the crater. &nbsp;It was so wide and shallow that there was no definite edge, and one easily could have walked down the slope rather comfortably, but there was nonetheless no mistaking the outer perimeter of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The other three, Kathryn and Jaren in environmental suits, Margaret more casually exposed behind them walked over and stood behind the robot, absorbed in taking in the scene, looking all around them. &nbsp;The terrain had a sandy rock colour to it, a dark yellow with a touch of red. &nbsp;What was most striking was the overriding blue hue everything had to it due to the different colour of the star above them. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t appear much bigger than suns they were used to, but that was only due to how much further away they were, how far away they had to be from a horrifying beast of a star like that to have a temperate planet like this.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Six,&rdquo; Kathryn remarked to the others, receiving confused looks in response. &nbsp; &ldquo;This is the <em>sixth</em> planet we&rsquo;ve set foot on.&rdquo; &nbsp;The others nodded in acknowledgement, appreciating that fact rather deeply for a moment before Ralph spoke up and shattered the reverence.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The energy profile from your shuttle&rsquo;s readings suggest that our own weapons caused this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;An accident maybe?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Inconceivable,&rdquo; the robot answered softly before dropping to his knees in apparent exhaustion.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn heard the all too familiar catch of Margaret&rsquo;s torch lighter and gave her a dirty look as she lit a cigar and puffed on it thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;What about the orbital shipyard?&rdquo; the simulant asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good question,&rdquo; Kathryn said as she opened a channel up to the ship on the panel on the inside of her wrist on the suit. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes captain, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It looks like the base was nuked&hellip; severely nuked. &nbsp;Scan the radiation environment in orbit, see if there&rsquo;s any anomalies. &nbsp;I believe we&rsquo;ve at least still got those sensors. &nbsp; You should be in just about the same orbit they would have had that station in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hold&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked over to the robot while she waited. &nbsp;It still seemed remarkably emotional for a being such as it was. &nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t expected it to be mournful of the destruction of its &lsquo;birthplace.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; Felix said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;On closer analysis there was definitely a massive nuclear explosion in this area. &nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t pick up on it right away because our radiation sensors are all thrown out of whack by the different star so it wasn&rsquo;t picked up right away, but when I calibrated to compensate for the radiation this blue beast is throwing out, yeah something hellish happened up here alright, and pretty recently too from the looks of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Like a few weeks recently?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah, exactly.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, thank you. &nbsp;Stand by.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn walked over to Ralph and sat down on her knees beside him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well what now Captain?&rdquo; she asked softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Any standing orders in this eventuality?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said evenly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She suddenly suspected that the very fabric of the universe could suddenly and inexplicably unravel all about them, and he would still have appropriate contingency orders to follow. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, so what now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now we report in to the capital,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The capital?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The central planet of the builder&rsquo;s civilization, their most recent homeworld. &nbsp; Now I need to report not only my fate, but ensure they are aware of what happened here as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Captain, fast movers coming in,&rdquo; Felix said over the comm in her ear.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kathryn called out, bolting to her feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;Report!!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two&hellip; no, three small craft coming in hot on an intercept course. &nbsp;They must have been hiding on the far side of the planet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aggressive?&rdquo; Kathryn said as she started running the short distance to the shuttle and motioned for the others to follow them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sure seem that way, they&rsquo;re on a collision course and they seem to be trying to blind us with-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that point all she heard was static. &nbsp;&ldquo;they&rsquo;re jamming the comm channels, dammit! &nbsp;Jaren get us up there now, emergency ascent.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Not bothering to get out of their suits, all four strapped themselves into their seats and braced themselves for the heavy load that an emergency ascent would. &nbsp;As Jaren throttled up the antimatter drive their seats changed shape and slid out into the interior of the shuttle to reorient the direction in which their bodies were taking the load. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that acceleration it only took a few minutes to reach orbit and come on approach to the New Horizon II. &nbsp;They could see three small ships leaving the vicinity of the ship but they were already too far away for them to be able to make out any detail about them. &nbsp;Jaren nimbly orchestrated a close approach and dock with the ship, and Kathryn was at the airlock door when it opened, where she was immediately greeted by a panicked looking and sounding Felix.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They, they came in too fast,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even have time to start up our weapons systems when they&rsquo;d already approached and boarded!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Boarded</em>!?&rdquo; Kathryn exclaimed in horror. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s not what they left behind Kat it&rsquo;s, what they took <em>with them</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you mean? &nbsp;What did they take with them?&rdquo; she asked, afraid of the answer, and the panic with which Felix was experiencing at telling her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They stole our computer core and, and they <em>took Maggie</em>!&rdquo;</p>
