            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The landscape was overwhelmingly orange, with a pronounced note of yellow in the sky and just the slightest tinge of blue. &nbsp;High up they could see the sun, their visors instantaneously darkening to filter out the harmful brilliance. &nbsp;It appeared reddish, it had a quality they all recognized form their own home worlds, it was the deep orangey red colour their own stars over the horizon at sunset. &nbsp; But here it had that quality right over their heads through a combination of the different actual colour of the star and the different atmosphere it was filtering through. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The land also had a remarkably orange tinge to it as well. &nbsp;It seemed from their initial study that it was a combination of a high concentration of iron oxide in the regolith, combined with the overwhelming orange hue of the atmosphere. &nbsp;In superficial appearance it looked remarkably like Mars minus the shade of yellow in the atmosphere, Kathryn considered as she looked around. &nbsp;She had visited the ruins of a lost city on Mars on vacation with her family. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a typical tourist destination, but Kathryn and Jaren both found exploration and study such interesting work, the unassigned kind was there preferred mode of vacation and relaxation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;But the ocean, wow. &nbsp;That was something definitely absent on Mars. &nbsp;It was dark, she wasn&rsquo;t prepared for that. &nbsp;With an orange sky instead of blue, and with high concentrations of iron in the water, it had the appearance of a remarkably dark blue with a strong orange highlight combined with a pronounced shade of green shimmer to it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I suppose we can&rsquo;t call it Mars II hunh?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Probably not appropriate, no.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe just Orange? &nbsp;No&hellip; &nbsp; Maybe just Epsilon?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Perhaps, but I think we can do better.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The problem is what culture&rsquo;s heritage should we draw from? &nbsp;Mine? &nbsp;Yours? &nbsp; Roma? &nbsp;Earth? &nbsp;Seems like every great name from Terran mythology has already been used in the Sol System&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; Clem said, approaching them from behind as the rest of the crew disembarked, each taking a moment to themselves to appreciate the moment before finally stepping down onto the surface.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Whatcha got?&rdquo; Kathryn asked, eager for suggestions.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Studying the Earth archives are a bit of a hobby for me, and while it is true that all of the good ancient greek names are taken up with bodies in the Sol System, hardly any celestial bodies are named after the prominent figures from the early days of Earth space flight, to whom all three of our worlds owe respect and admiration.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Great point, who do you have in mind?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Two come immediately to mind, Yuri Gagarin was the first human to enter space and orbit the planet, and later Neil Armstrong was the first to set foot on the moon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hunh. &nbsp; What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, the whole first to set foot on thing would seem relevant, but the more I think about it, the more &lsquo;Yuri&rsquo; seems to have a nice simple ring to it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was going to say the same thing. &nbsp;Jaren?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Seems perfectly fair and appropriate to me. &nbsp;I imagine we&rsquo;ll do a lot of mining from the early space flight days for naming all of these new bodies we&rsquo;re going to come across, now that we have access to that history again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s agreed then, Yuri. &nbsp;Hey everybody! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re standing on Yuri! &nbsp;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Some nodded, others shrugged, but nobody protested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay, Yuri.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn walked over to the shuttle, standing beside the ramp she reached inside and pulled out the Star Fleet flag on a post which had been mounted to the interior. &nbsp;&ldquo;Gather around everybody, everyone hold this. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll do it together.&rdquo; &nbsp;All six people put their gloved hands on the flag post. &nbsp;&ldquo;In the name of Star Fleet, and the four noble worlds who&rsquo;s cooperation brought it into existence, I formally name this planet &lsquo;Yuri&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Together they brought the post down to the ground, but it was rock, and all they accomplished was a &lsquo;<em>tink</em>&rsquo; sound as the metal post bounced off. &nbsp;They paused, then tried again a couple times. &nbsp;&lsquo;<em>Tink, tink</em>&rsquo;. &nbsp;They stared at the ground for several moments in disbelief at the foolish and silly ignorance of what they had just attempted. &nbsp;There was no soil on this world because there&rsquo;d never been any life. &nbsp;It was only solid rock they had just tried to drive a metal post into.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sighed heavily. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll get the drill&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Several trip later, when the rest of the crew had all had a chance, Kathryn and Jaren returned for a second time, this time with their daughter Maggie, and their old simulant friend Margaret. &nbsp;Margaret had forgone the environmental suit, confident that her artificial skin could withstand the toxic atmosphere. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;If she were stranded there, there was a good chance it would eventually start to eat away and dissolve her skin, but the same could be said of the crew&rsquo;s environmental suits. &nbsp;Her simulant body had originally been programmed to simulate suffocation and temporary death if confronted with unbreathable air or an absence of air altogether, but when this concern arose, Margaret only cryptically reminded them with a scolding index finger, &ldquo;Upgrades children, upgrades&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After the shuttle landed and the ramps extended, they encouraged Maggie to step out first. &nbsp;She cautiously stepped out, having to concentrate on taking proper steps down the ramp amidst her sense of being overwhelmed by what she was seeing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Wow it&rsquo;s so&hellip; alien,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret stepped off the ramp behind her and came around to stand beside her. &nbsp;The casual way she did gave the impression that this was the most ordinary thing a person could possibly do, the least biggest deal in the universe. &nbsp;New planet? &nbsp; So what? &nbsp;Who needs it?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no oxygen here. &nbsp;What good is a planet you can&rsquo;t even enjoy a good cigar on?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You might be missing the point Margaret,&rdquo; Maggie politely suggested. &nbsp;Margaret was not only Maggie&rsquo;s namesake, but both with Margaret being such close friends with her parents, and having lived on the same station the whole time Maggie had been growing up, she had taken on something of a godmother role in her life. &nbsp;Her parents were so proper and controlled, and Maggie unreservedly relished the rather more surly and consciously unrefined way Margaret had about her. &nbsp;This frequently gave her parents pause over the kind of influence the simulant had on their child, but they readily appreciated that the two identified with each other in a way their daughter hadn&rsquo;t managed to find in either of her parents. &nbsp;For better or worse, it was Margaret who had been the strongest influence in Maggie pursuing her artistic inclinations when they&rsquo;d originally manifested. &nbsp;(must retcon that she smokes, and that she grows tobacco herself to facilitate this, and that she had the most blessed cigar in history after half a millennium without between books)</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Enh, shows what you know,&rdquo; Margaret retorted dismissively.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Maggie understood as well as anybody who was close to the simulant that the more affection she had for them, the more playfully she would condescendingly dismiss like this. &nbsp;It just wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort for those she didn&rsquo;t care for. &nbsp;If she merely ignored you altogether, then you could be sure she didn&rsquo;t care for you. &nbsp;She was too old to be bothered with anything more effort than that, with any social niceties she deemed a waste of time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The beauty is in itself,&rdquo; Jaren said as he and Kathryn joined them, &ldquo;not in what we can use it for.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret turned to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Says the people who want to infect this supposedly perfect as it is world with this messy and chaotic biology you&rsquo;re all so proud of?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s both,&rdquo; Kathryn negotiated with a shrug. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful as it is, but it could be a different kind of beautiful as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well better make a living planet of a dead one than the other way around I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the spirit,&rdquo; Jaren offered in dead pan with playfully dismissive delivery in return. &nbsp; &ldquo;You just remember that you can&rsquo;t get artificial intelligence without biological intelligence first.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Says you. &nbsp; Get back to me when you&rsquo;ve explored the other sextillion star systems out there. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren rolled his eyes and shook his head in amusement. &nbsp;&ldquo;I believe you will. &nbsp;But the rest of us, you know&hellip; mortality.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah well, as a great philosopher once said a thousand years ago, &lsquo;life&rsquo;s a bitch and then you die,&rsquo; emphasis on the <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Excuse me, weren&rsquo;t you literally on your last leg when we found you? &nbsp;How much longer you think you would have lasted if we hadn&rsquo;t rescued you from the dank bowels of that dam?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Enh,&rdquo; she shrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;Long enough.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren gave up.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Did you find anything interesting in those tidal pools?&rdquo; Maggie asked. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been doing her homework on what they should be on the lookout for.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not really&hellip;&rdquo; her mother answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We took samples back from the first trip, and they&rsquo;ve been analyzing them ever since. &nbsp; There seems to be all sort of complex chemistry both organic and inorganic, but nothing seems to have spontaneously stumbled upon a form that self-replicates.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You mean that for billions of years&hellip;&rdquo; the girl marvelled, &ldquo;with all the right ingredients, during all the time there was life on our four worlds&hellip; the right combination just what? &nbsp;Never came up? &nbsp;Never happened to happen by coincidence?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Looks that way, yes.&rdquo; Kathryn answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find any evidence of any inhibiting factor which would otherwise prevent it. &nbsp; So what do you think that means Maggie?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It means, that either this planet never developing the most basic forms of life is an extremely unlucky planet-&ldquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Or lucky,&rdquo; Margaret interjected, with scolding stares from both Kathryn and Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ignoring her, Maggie continued: &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ve been extremely lucky that there were four planets we could find nearby in which it did. &nbsp;Either it never happening on this planet, or it happening on all four of ours have extreme odds against them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we figure,&rdquo; Jaren confirmed for her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That we need to do a lot more study, gather more and more data points to compare. &nbsp; Either we&rsquo;ll find many many more planets with some form or life, or find that they don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the only way we can answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The girl seemed star struck as she considered the scope of the puzzle, and the challenges which lay ahead to solve it. &nbsp;Her parents found themselves wondering if the experience might be awakening in her the latent spirit of passion for discovery which must be somewhere in her bones as their child, but they both chose not to dwell on it since they&rsquo;d both resolved long ago to not actively try to steer her in any particular direction. &nbsp;They hoped though.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Admiral?</em>&rdquo; she heard Felix ask in her ear. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>You should return to the ship.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was an ominous pause. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Unknown.</em>&rdquo; he answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>There is&hellip; an anomaly in the outer system.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What kind of anomaly&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Dammit Kat, if I knew that I would have opened with that.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He sounded agitated and concerned, very unlike him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well what can you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s not natural, and it&rsquo;s not ours.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Jaren stared at each other over the significance of those words. &nbsp;In all their travels and exploration, short of the ancient Haven cephalopod civilization which archaeology showed rudimentary electronics technology, there had never been any hint of a whisper of any technology but their own. &nbsp;Definitively stating that it was not natural and not theirs, if he was right, could only mean one thing. &nbsp;First contact. &nbsp;They had all been trained for such an eventuality, but the training was never taken very seriously. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Contact was something they all used to dream about as children, but as they grew into adults and trained officers, their wonder at the possibility fell deep into the dark recesses of their minds along with magic and gods. &nbsp;Part of their training was to understand the utter ambiguity of such a detection. &nbsp;It could be omniscient beings finally here to grant us the secrets and keys to the universe, or the initial scout ship of a malevolent force bent on reshaping every world they saw to their own needs, intent on turning their worlds into something like Yuri perhaps and them utterly powerless to do anything about it. &nbsp; There was only one way to find out.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way up. &nbsp;Immediately.&rdquo;</p>
