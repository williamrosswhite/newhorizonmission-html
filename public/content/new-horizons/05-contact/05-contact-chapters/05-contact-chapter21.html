            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had asked to have a bit of time to consult with her crew on how they would proceed, and Bill obliged and returned inside the building on the platform. &nbsp;He provided a frequency with which he could be reached on their scrolls when they were ready.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She ordered the others to go enjoy the gardens while she conferred privately with Jaren. &nbsp; After reaching him on the scroll, she relayed all of the relevant information from her long conversation with Bill.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought that our most advanced weapons are so antiquated for them that they&rsquo;d never thought to use them before?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know, I know&hellip; it boggles the mind.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s our play then?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip; what are our options?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, we can have a grand party while the galaxy burns,&rdquo; she suggested sardonically.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not my first choice.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No mine neither. &nbsp;We could wash our hands of all of it and just cut our losses and portal back home. &nbsp;I doubt they&rsquo;d let us take our warheads with us, but I bet they&rsquo;d let us leave otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maggie is not acceptable losses though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;Of course now. &nbsp;So, we could instead commit our ship and crew to a galactic civil war in which we&rsquo;ve only heard one side&rsquo;s version of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fair point, but it is the other side who has taken her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bingo.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There could be another option you may not have considered.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sounds like they need our warheads, not our ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What if we could have everything we want? &nbsp;What if we could send the ship home without us or the warheads, but stay here ourselves and go after Maggie? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s as important as anything else at this point to get all of the information we&rsquo;ve collected back to Command after all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If we could pull that off&hellip;&rdquo; she looked out over the vast landscape in front of her, &ldquo;it would definitely be the best of all bad options.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I agree. &nbsp; See what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain,&rdquo; she derided him. &nbsp;He waved her off with playful irritation and the line closed. &nbsp;She opened a new one to Bill and said she was ready to see him. &nbsp; She wandered over to the area where they had come through the floor and before long it shimmered away and was replaced by the rising platform Bill arrived on, accompanied as always by the silver ball through which they communicated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Have you reached a decision?&rdquo; Bill asked through the ball.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to negotiate, how bout that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fair.&rdquo; He gestured to a padded bench with his double jointed arm, inviting her to sit. &nbsp; When she had, he climbed up onto it himself, and sat down with its four legs folded up underneath itself. &nbsp;&ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My daughter back,&rdquo; she answered very seriously.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And the only possible way I can see that happening is working with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I propose that my ship be sent back to our home world with it&rsquo;s crew, while I and a couple others stay here with the weapons to formulate a plan to locate and retrieve Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This arrangement is in principle acceptable for us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That would require you opening a portal for us for the ship to go through.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course. &nbsp; I feel obligated to mention though, that with your computer core, the enemy is aware of your civilization. &nbsp;It is impossible to know what they would do with that information however.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What if they decide to come looking for our antimatter weapons instead of building their own?&rdquo; Kathryn asked in horror.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is a possibility. &nbsp;However, I doubt this will be their first recourse. &nbsp;It is unlikely that you have a large enough supply to win them the war, and their preference will be to build up their own capacity as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right&hellip; &nbsp; All the same, I think I&rsquo;ll leave instructions with the ship to ask about securing additional weapons and sending them through for us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;As I said Captain, you do not have sufficient weapons to win the war for either side. &nbsp; Your own weapons would be best used defending your own portals in case we have miscalculated the likely actions of our enemy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, right&hellip; well I&rsquo;ll at least leave instructions to take up just such a defensive position. &nbsp;Will you leave us the ability to contact you? &nbsp;To open the portal to your world?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course. &nbsp; As I said we wish to be friends. &nbsp; You are the fourth race after all. &nbsp; We seek peaceful collaboration, and we look forward to collaborating and introducing you to the other three races as well. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just this war&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand. &nbsp; Bill, tell me more about this Link. &nbsp; Have you found a way to communicate faster than light?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, only by sending communications through a portal have we been able to accomplish this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So how do you maintain a system like The Link across star systems?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Updates,&rdquo; it explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;From this central planet, updates are issued every day through the portal to a special system where all we have there is the update facility. &nbsp;This facility&rsquo;s sole job is to cycle through dialing every active portal we have and transmitting the update. &nbsp;On the other side in every system is a local node which broadcasts the update to any receiving nodes in the system. &nbsp;If a piece of information urgently requires dissemination, a new update is issued and the process begins anew. &nbsp;There is a hierarchy of systems in such a way that most vital systems are updated first with both the standard and supplemental updates.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But without real time communications, how do you er, well&hellip; &lsquo;become one&rsquo; with the rest of your people?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You misunderstand. &nbsp;We do not link and become one with other Bobbins, we become one with the information provided by The Link, which includes all of the life experience and wisdom of those who are also a part of The Link past and present. &nbsp;We are unified with our species and all its accumulated knowledge and wisdom, not in real time link with all of the others.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So how does your enemy operate as a hive mind the way you describe?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They are controlled by The Link, and operate based on the latest instructions provided by updates. &nbsp;They operate on their most recently received instructions.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So&hellip; every one of you has the sum total of your civilization&rsquo;s knowledge inside your personal hardware?&rdquo; the idea of that kind of storage capacity boggled her mind.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Dang. &nbsp; So how does it work now? &nbsp;Does your enemy have access to your updates? &nbsp; Do they have their own system now?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;When the war broke out we both shifted frequencies and encryption, and now operate parallel systems.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t just intercept one of their update broadcasts and use the information?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So if we could access one of their nodes&hellip; we could learn everything we needed to know couldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Where my daughter is! &nbsp;Where our computer core is, whether or not they&rsquo;ve realized about the anti-matter weapons, how their progress in creating them is coming, if they&rsquo;ve already invaded our home worlds!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, accessing the systems on a node directly would allow us access to the Link database, but nodes are the most heavily defended facilities. &nbsp;To successfully launch an incursion would require&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unusually effective weapons?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The creature looked up at her squarely with one black eye. &nbsp;&ldquo;Those weapons are required to defend this system.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You said it yourself, they wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to stop an all-out assault, and they&rsquo;re unlikely to launch one anyways. &nbsp;You need a new plan, a different strategy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Something bold, something so stupid they&rsquo;d never see it coming&hellip; something which could win the war all at once.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We infiltrate a primary enemy Link node.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We could not commit those weapons to such an assault.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well maybe an overt assault isn&rsquo;t necessary, what about a small covert team? &nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t you disguise one of your ships as one of theirs so you could safely approach?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The creatures seemed to sigh as he said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not possible&hellip; although-&rdquo; he took on that vacant distant stare he had when he was consulting The Link. &nbsp;&ldquo;There <em>is</em> an asset we have been holding onto for a mission it could be best suited for.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We captured a small vessel some time ago which was on a deep space mission. &nbsp;It is scheduled to return to base relatively soon. &nbsp; You see, any ship we captured as soon as it missed a scheduled report in, its signature would be delisted and presumed hostile when encountered again, similarly to the way we initially regarded Ralph and his claims. &nbsp;The base it is due to return to is as well guarded as any other, but&hellip; if we could get aboard using that ship, we could access the database directly and extract whatever information we wished, their entire Link archive for that matter!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you think of this plan on your own already?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We did, but the value of the plan is contingent on being able to leave the system safely. &nbsp;Otherwise we have no way to relay what we have learned back here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But now you have a surprise which can help you escape.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The warheads?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The warheads. &nbsp; What could you do with that information?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, if we shot our way out, the value of the information would rapidly deteriorate. &nbsp; They would immediately shift their Link encryption since we could access it with the information we stole, they would redeploy their fleet but that would take a bit more time&hellip; we would learn all about their research and their ultimate plans though. &nbsp;It would be valuable enough for us to make the attempt in any case.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright it&rsquo;s settled then. &nbsp;You will send my ship and crew back home through the portal while I and a couple others stay behind with our antimatter warheads and help you execute this plan which will allow us to locate my daughter and our computer core. &nbsp;We play it by ear from there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p>
