            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Having sent Maggie to her suite, Kathryn, Jaren, and Margaret headed directly for the bridge after docking the shuttle. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Report.&rdquo; Kathryn ordered as they passed the door way and pulled themselves into their respective seats and did up their harnesses.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix answered. &nbsp; &ldquo;Well you can see the zoomed up image here on the wall. &nbsp;It looks rather like a thing of grapes with lots of bulbs covering a roughly triangular shape with what appears to be one large engine port currently slowing it down.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slowing down? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s its heading?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We calculated that it appears to be on course to enter orbit around the sun. &nbsp;Well technically of course it&rsquo;s already in orbit around the sun like everything else is, but its engine is felling its orbit to get closer and closer to it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Distance?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Forty million kilometers. &nbsp;Whoa.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;its deceleration&hellip; it&rsquo;s really crushing it&hellip; over fifty gees. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t detect it before, it wasn&rsquo;t <em>here</em> before. &nbsp;It must have come in at a significant portion of the speed of light, then hammered the brakes once it was in the system.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Have you tried to scan it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, we were waiting on you for that, impossible to say how it would interpret that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good man.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn studied the strange looking ship on the wall in front of her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this by the books. &nbsp;First send the First Contact Package.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, transmitting now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The First Contact Package was a communications package all ships had buried in their storage banks for just such an occasion. &nbsp;It offered peaceful greetings in all known languages and basic information about humans. &nbsp;A prime number sequence was used as a frame to communicate in math and binary at first and it was hoped, serve as an invitation to develop ever more sophisticated means of communicating.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren undid his harness and floated over to Kathryn. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hard to say yet.&rdquo; &nbsp;She was working hard to avoid as best as possible any undue speculation.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wonder about it not having made any attempt to communicate with us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes that is interesting. &nbsp;It must see us here as readily as we see it there. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;At least we&rsquo;ve been able to determine it isn&rsquo;t native to this system. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sub light so it couldn&rsquo;t be from anywhere at all, but at that speed it could have come from any number of star systems.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;True. &nbsp; It looks too small to be a colony ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And any life forms like we&rsquo;ve ever encountered would be liquefied by that extreme a deceleration.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She allowed herself a smirk at him. &nbsp;Liquefied was an exaggeration, but not by too much. &nbsp;Crushed, certainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a probe,&rdquo; she surmised, &ldquo;like the ones we sent out.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A reasonable hypothesis&hellip; but to what end?&rdquo; Jaren asked himself as well as her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is it possible that it came here to establish a rift system like ours?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What happens if two different rift systems try to operate around the same star?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&hellip; have to do the math,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; it <em>is</em> incredibly fast. &nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s just a probe that will transmit information back. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s from a world fifteen light years away say, and it could accelerate at that speed it could get up to ninety percent of light pretty quick, cruise there to avoid significant relativistic effects, get here in twenty or twenty five years, transmit data back&hellip; a thirty five year mission for the researchers back home? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not unreasonable is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well with acceleration like that they certainly couldn&rsquo;t take the trip themselves&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren conceded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any response from our transmission?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Felix.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well no, but it&rsquo;s far enough away that it would have just arrived.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;So they waited. &nbsp; And waited. &nbsp;Time seemed to be passing so slowly as they all nearly held their breath awaiting a response. &nbsp;The only sound on the bridge aside from the soft beeps and boops of the consoles and equipment was the slow successive rapping of Kathryn&rsquo;s fingers against her arm rest. &nbsp;It irritated many, but she was in charge and it was no one&rsquo;s place to complain.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Margaret, calculate how long it takes for a signal to travel back and forth and put up on the screen a count up of the time they&rsquo;ve had to respond but chosen not to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The sim nodded and turned her chair to work at her station&rsquo;s panel. &nbsp;It was a rather simple request. &nbsp;&ldquo;Going up&hellip; now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Red digits appeared over the ship with days and hours zeroed out, minutes at seven, seconds, and thirty-two and milliseconds flashing by too quickly to see clearly as the seconds ticked up.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Kathryn asked in frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;And days? &nbsp;Really?&rdquo; she asked Margaret, who just shrugged. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn called Jaren over. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how long is reasonable to wait. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to rush it, but I certainly don&rsquo;t want to leave it days. &nbsp; At some point we can be reasonably assured that it either didn&rsquo;t understand or is choosing to ignore us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I agree, but how long is up to you. &nbsp;You might want to gradually ramp up your scanning over time to avoid a sudden barrage. &nbsp; Give it some time then start with a passive radar scan maybe, then work your way up to-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting a response&hellip;&rdquo; Felix called out as he looked off into the distance listening in his ear piece. &nbsp;He tapped at his panel and it came in over the bridge loudspeaker.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>More.</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;The language was eerily robotic and disembodied.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;More information I would guess.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;About what? &nbsp; Us? &nbsp;Our language?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d guess our language,&rdquo; Jaren answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;If it had more of our language to work with you&rsquo;d think it could ask us more specifically.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix how long until it&rsquo;s slowed enough to enter an orbit around the sun similar to our rift satellites?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;About thirty hours. &nbsp;its deceleration is slowing as it gets closer in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp; Alright, well Margaret, please transmit any and all books the crew brought with them on this trip. &nbsp;Between all of us there should be a fair amount.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Um humn&hellip; give me one second&hellip; yup I think that&rsquo;s everything. &nbsp;Alright, book away. &nbsp;Aaaaand&hellip; they should have received by now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re being scanned,&rdquo; Felix reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;The heavy stuff too, it&rsquo;s mapping our interior and personnel.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well then by all means Felix, return the favour.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, commencing comprehensive scan&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;A few moments passed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hunh. &nbsp; Well that&rsquo;s funny&hellip; I wonder if I try&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong. &nbsp; All my penetrating scans just bounce off the exterior, I can&rsquo;t get inside. &nbsp;The hull must be made of some kind of material we&rsquo;ve never encountered before, or&hellip; or it&rsquo;s shielded in some way I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren floated over to Felix&rsquo;s station and looked at his work over his shoulder. &nbsp; &ldquo;Kathryn everything we&rsquo;ve learned so far suggests this thing whatever it is is advanced well beyond us. &nbsp;We should be cautious.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded that she understood. &nbsp;She was already thinking the same way.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;its scans have ceased,&rdquo; Felix reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; I guess we wait to see if-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>What is your purpose?</em>&rdquo; that same eerie voice came in over the bridge speakers.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked at the others and they all seemed stumped. &nbsp;She pushed a button on her arm rest to patch in her chair&rsquo;s microphone to respond. &nbsp;&ldquo;Greetings. &nbsp; We are explorers in an organization we call Star Fleet, commissioned by humans like us of four different worlds.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked inquisitively up at Jaren and his face contorted to express a sentiment of &lsquo;yeah, sure, that was good.&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Your purpose here is exploration?</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They were a little under three light seconds apart, so each response and reply had an agonizingly long six second or so delay.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp; What is yours?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>To establish an interstellar portal in this star system.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned off her microphone and looked at Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;So you were right, they&rsquo;re here to set up a rift.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned the microphone back on.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;To whom am I speaking? &nbsp;Where are you from?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>The existing portal system around this star is yours?</em>&rdquo; it asked. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The way it completely ignored her own question of its own origins suddenly made it uncomfortable. &nbsp;Her sense of caution slowly began giving way to concern.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp; Who are you?&rdquo; she asked more forcefully.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>We cannot operate parallel rift systems.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The words haunted her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then perhaps we can work together to enable mutu-&rdquo; &nbsp;She was cut off by the second half of the alien ship&rsquo;s transmission she hadn&rsquo;t known was coming.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Your portal system will be destroyed. &nbsp;Do not attempt to interfere.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is unacceptable!&rdquo; Kathryn yelled angrily at the disembodied voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;We must be able to work together to both have access to the same system! &nbsp;You <em>cannot</em> simply destroy our system, certainly not before we can traverse it, we will be stranded here!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Six seconds, ten seconds, fifteen seconds&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>DAMMIT!!</em>&rdquo; Kathryn roared as she hammered her fists down on her arm rests. &nbsp;&ldquo;Options!?&rdquo; she angrily demanded from the others around her. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We could keep trying to communicate with it,&rdquo; Jaren half-heartedly offered, clearly unconvinced himself that anything could come of it. &nbsp;&ldquo;We could keep trying to reason with it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If it destroys even one of our collecting satellites around the star&hellip;&rdquo; Felix said shaking his head, &ldquo;our system becomes inoperable. &nbsp;We only have six months of regular provisions onboard, and six months of emergency supplies beyond that. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nowhere in this system to resupply either.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren is there any way we could use their system after they&rsquo;ve destroyed theirs and established their own?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly unlikely,&rdquo; he answered with a heavy heart. &nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even be sure it&rsquo;s the same kind of technology. &nbsp;Even if it is, what kind of frequencies and activation codes are involved&hellip; we make a point of locking our system out to those who aren&rsquo;t authorized, they must too. &nbsp;Besides, even if we had their blessing, there&rsquo;s no way to know if our two systems are mutually compatible. &nbsp;Each may only be able to access their own rifts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The room was silent for what seemed like an eternity.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll say it if no one else will,&rdquo; Margaret spoke up, &ldquo;we <em>have</em> missiles.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You want to attack them.&rdquo; Kathryn balked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Attacking them seems to be our only move other than resign ourselves to a slow agonizing death, which I&rsquo;ll have to watch all of you suffer before dying of boredom and loneliness myself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Molly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why do we <em>have</em> those weapons then Kathryn? &nbsp;If not for this kind of situation?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They have clear hostile intent and by their actions are condemning every human on this ship to death. &nbsp;What clearer justification is there?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thoughts?&rdquo; Kathryn asked of everyone else on the bridge.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The pilot turned around and said only: &ldquo;I trust your judgement ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn got the impression that she agreed with Molly but didn&rsquo;t have the heart to say so. &nbsp;In fact she got that same impression from everyone on the bridge. &nbsp;Nobody wanted to fire on the first other species they&rsquo;d come across in space, but by a little bit more nobody wanted to die cold and alone out here. &nbsp;Everyone wanted the chance to come home a little more than they hated the idea of attacking.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn leaned forward, laced her fingers together and put them under her chin in concentration as she studied the ship on the screen in front of her. &nbsp;Why couldn&rsquo;t this have gone differently, she asked herself. &nbsp;She silently cursed the ship for putting her in this position. &nbsp;She was responsible for all of the lives under her command though. &nbsp; She had a duty to do everything she could to get them home.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is our compliment of weapons?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren floated back to his seat and tapped at his panel as he strapped himself in. &nbsp; &ldquo;Besides our primary laser, twenty four missiles, twelve nuclear, twelve anti-matter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Problem is we don&rsquo;t know what kind of weapons they do or don&rsquo;t have over there. &nbsp;We can either completely annihilate them on our first volley, or fire a warning shot and risk them destroying us before we can respond.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They likely have some kind of weapon if they intend to disable our satellite network,&rdquo; Jaren advised.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Kathryn decided, leaning back. &nbsp;&ldquo;I want to be sure to severely disable them but I don&rsquo;t want to completely destroy them. &nbsp; Ready one nuke and dial it down to low yield. &nbsp;All those bulbs&hellip; I&rsquo;d bet that those are their equivalent of our collecting satellites, or at least what will shape into collecting satellites when they&rsquo;re deployed. &nbsp; Maybe if we destroy enough of those it&rsquo;ll realize its mission is impossible and have to negotiate with us to get home using our system. &nbsp;If&hellip; that&rsquo;s even possible of course.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fair reasoning,&rdquo; Jaren granted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Missile ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn thought of their daughter and said a silent prayer to herself that this was the right decision for her sake. &nbsp;There was no deity she expressed this to, it was more a strong deliberate wishing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jared tapped the panel and a small missile was seen emerging from the ghostly outline of their ship around them, and become visually fully realized as it emerged from its tube and the anti-matter rocket forcefully fired to accelerate beyond the speeds the linear magnetic launcher in the tube had imparted on it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Missile away. &nbsp; Time on target&hellip; twelve minute.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh for&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn muttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fucking eternity!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jaren shrugged, &ldquo;space is really <em>really</em> big.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sighed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Admiral&hellip; I&rsquo;m detecting a massive power build up in the alien craft.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She looked up at the screen and watched as it turned around to face the forward point of its cone shape towards them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They all watched as a soft glow in a recess at its tip grew brighter and brighter until it hurt their eyes to look at it and the cameras began filtering out the more blinding parts of the light. &nbsp;Finally a blinding pillar of yellow and white light fell upon them like a cosmic thunderbolt previously only seen in the old god Zeus&rsquo; worst nightmares.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The ship shuddered in what felt like a catastrophic way, but they were still there a few seconds later when the beam subsided. &nbsp;The screens about them were blank and the lights were dim when they happened to flicker on, and emergency lights and sirens filled the air.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Damage report!!</em>&rdquo; Kathryn yelled.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re still here&hellip;&rdquo; Felix answered as he tapped his panel, then hammered it with his fist in anger over its inoperability before moving over the next console with was thankfully working. &nbsp;&ldquo;Most of our instruments on the forward section of the ship are gone, utterly sheared away from that blast, but the hull underneath held. &nbsp;Just barely though. &nbsp;If we get hit again like that, full power dead on, we haven&rsquo;t a hope. &nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be vaporized on the spot. We have to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Pilot turn us around and head back for the planet at full military thrust. &nbsp;Get us out of line of sight of that damn ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes&hellip; yes, Admiral,&rdquo; the young pilot was clearly shaken, but following protocol on instinct made a ship wide announcement to warn the crew. &nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Warning warning, full military thrust. &nbsp;Five seconds to activate pressure wraps.</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;All Kathryn could do was hope that all of the crew were following protocol and were already in pressure wrap chairs which as their names implied, put a cover over your entire body and limbs separately and squeezed hard to prevent blood from pooling away from the brain. &nbsp;She had to hope against hope as well, that her daughter had heeded her orientation and gotten into one of the chairs before when the emergency had sounded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s seat wraps came up and over her torso, arms, and legs individually and squeezed hard until they were so tight they quite hurt.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Five, four, three, two, one&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The main antimatter engines roared to life and the ship began accelerating back towards the planet at ten gees, pushing them agonizingly into chair. &nbsp;Their course was locked in since even with the wraps there was a fifty-fifty chance any one of them would pass out under this load, including the pilot.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn tried to croak out a report on the missile, but she could barely breathe as it was, and there was a good chance Jaren was unconscious anyways.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A minute later they were behind the planet and out of the alien weapon&rsquo;s line of sight from the high orbit they had been at on the near side of the planet.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The pilot had passed out and Kathryn ordered Margaret to get to the pilot&rsquo;s chair and take over until she regained consciousness. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the status of the missile?&rdquo; she demanded of Jaren who had also managed to remain conscious.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hold on&hellip; I&rsquo;m patching into our satellites around the star.&rdquo; &nbsp;They were out of line of sight of the alien spaceship, but still within line of sight of the star. &nbsp;He managed to put up on the wall screen a telescope feed from one of the solar satellites. &nbsp;It had nowhere near the resolution of the now blown away telescopes on the ship, but it was enough.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Contact in seven, six, five, four, three, two, one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They all watched as the image of the ship was replaced with a blinding white light which the system automatically filtered down to what their eyes could handle and then resume normal imaging as the image settled. &nbsp;It was hard to make out how badly damaged the ship was from their attack.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They were fortunate that the missile had made it at all. &nbsp;If it had travelled in a straight line from New Horizon II to the alien ship it would have surely been destroyed in the pillar of light with nearly destroyed New Horizon II. &nbsp;It was a smart weapon though, programmed to zig and zag its flight path in an unpredictable way when it detected countermeasures against it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is that the best you can do?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hang on&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to try to set up an interferometric link between several satellites. &nbsp;Here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Combining the resolution of several satellites was tricky, but once successful produced a resolution which rivaled the ship&rsquo;s original primary telescope. &nbsp;The pilot woke up to join in their horror at the absolute untouched appearance of the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t&hellip; even scratch it.&rdquo; Kathryn whispered to herself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ready one antimatter missile; maximum yield. &nbsp;Fire when ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Missile away. &nbsp; Time on target, twelve minutes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Felix, you still with us?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix&rsquo;s head bolted up in disoriented panic. &nbsp;He had been unconscious but had just woken up again. &nbsp;&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The nuke appears to have had no effect. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve launched a maximum yield antimatter missile. &nbsp;I need a comprehensive damage report from you. &nbsp;Can you do that for me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I, of&hellip; of course, yeah.&rdquo; He said as turned around to his console, shaking the cobwebs from his head as he did so.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Pilot, you good?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Admiral, thank you,&rdquo; she said as she took her seat back from Margaret.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good. &nbsp;I need you to plot an elongated orbit which keeps us behind the planet to that ship for as long as possible. &nbsp;Calculate the burn we&rsquo;ll need to conduct when we come around again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Admiral, right away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Molly, I want you to survey the rest of the ship and assess if we have any casualties.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret nodded respectfully, appreciating that this was no time for jokes. &nbsp;As she floated away from the pilot station and past Kathryn, she grabbed the simulant&rsquo;s arm and squeezed it as she looked in her eyes. &nbsp;Margaret put her hand on Kathryn&rsquo;s and quietly reassured her: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check on her first Kat. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn nodded at her and released her arm.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A minute later Felix was ready to give his full report. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good, but it&rsquo;s not catastrophic,&rdquo; he offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Obviously our propulsion and tactical systems are still functioning, but our hull is dangerously compromised. &nbsp;At its thinnest it&rsquo;s been reduced to just over five percent, barely enough to hold out against the vacuum. &nbsp;A hard kick could do us in. &nbsp;Emergency bulkheads would kick in, but that wouldn&rsquo;t help those in that section. &nbsp; Hell I&rsquo;m surprised it survived that heavy burn.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren, evacuate anyone in a section with a hull thickness below twenty percent, and seal off those sections as a precaution.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on it,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What else Felix?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Our electrical and data systems are right fried. &nbsp;Half of our stations here on the bridge are fried, everything is on manual control, and only that one wall panel is working in here. &nbsp;Communications are intermittent at best.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fixable?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He sighed. &nbsp; &ldquo;Patchable. &nbsp;At best, in parts. &nbsp;Any better would take returning to dock for a comprehensive refit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood. &nbsp; Do what you can.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Missile is three minutes out,&rdquo; Jaren reported a couple minutes later after Kathryn gave her people some time to work. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d even refrained from tapping her fingers to avoid distracting them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good. &nbsp; And those sections?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It took me some time to figure out how to communicate with people in that section, but I managed to just sound the evacuation alarm in those sections and they&rsquo;re all almost out. &nbsp;Should be able to seal it up before the missile strike.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;At that moment Margaret returned to the bridge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Two people are still unconscious from the heavy thrust, they didn&rsquo;t manage to get to their wraps in time, but they should be fine. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re in the infirmary. &nbsp;Everyone else seems alert and awaiting instructions but visibly shaken and disturbed. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re professionals though, you can count on them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And Maggie?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. &nbsp; This is clearly more excitement than she&rsquo;d expected, but she seems oddly thrilled at the excitement actually. &nbsp;As she&rsquo;d been instructed she was already in her chair and was all wrapped up when we thrusted. &nbsp;She claims she didn&rsquo;t even lose consciousness. &nbsp;She seemed more worried about us than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Does she know what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t, but I explained it to her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s fascinated.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Kathryn said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s not too afraid.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Missile strike imminent,&rdquo; Jaren reported, and they all looked at the remaining working wall panel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Five, four, three, two, one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The blast looked very much the same, but on a scale orders of magnitude greater. &nbsp;The whole screen was washed out in white light and luminesced for longer before settling down. &nbsp;The missile consisted only of a ball of antimatter hydrogen compressed into a solid in a heavy magnetic bottle. &nbsp;When it struck regular matter and shattered, the antimatter material sprayed out onto the regular matter and each antimatter particle annihilated a regular matter particle and released a tremendous amount of matter.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When the light subsided, the telescope system zoomed in again. &nbsp;The result was very different this time. &nbsp;The rear half of the ship had a concave section excised from it, like some great beast had come up and taken a great big bite out of the side of the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; Kathryn observed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Report.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;its power readings have&hellip; dropped off a cliff,&rdquo; Felix reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;its engine has clearly stopped working and it&rsquo;s merely ballistic now. &nbsp; I doubt its weapon is working either. &nbsp; Even if it was, I can&rsquo;t imagine it having the power to use it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s dead in the water Kat.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright then, now maybe we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
