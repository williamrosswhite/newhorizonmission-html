            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The team watched from the command room as their small ship approached the much larger station. &nbsp; It was the same opaque black as everything else seemed to be, but its shape was distinct from anything they&rsquo;d seen before. &nbsp;As a six sided double pyramid shape it certainly fit in with all of the other regular shaped vessels they&rsquo;d seen so far. &nbsp;As they approached for a dock, Jaren craned his neck upwards to see the station, and Bill informed them that the entire station was constructed of the same shifting matter as their own vessel.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they detect that we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No. &nbsp;The material of the hull is impervious to any external scans. &nbsp;In this situation the station relies on other vessel&rsquo;s internal sensors to make such a determination. &nbsp;We are currently sending a false reading indicating that this vessel is completely uninhabited.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That bridge go both ways?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bill said as he replaced the now completely obscured view screen wall with an enhanced internal layout of the station. &nbsp;There were purple triangles around the enemy Bobbins, and a single green square elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How many is that?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Looks to be ten hostiles,&rdquo; Bill answered, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re not our biggest concern.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tactical drones. &nbsp;At a moment&rsquo;s notice innumerable drones can be formed out of the hull material to attack us with weapons similar to the wands you were practicing with. &nbsp;Wands can temporarily disable the matter, but more can always be made, and the immobilization is fleeting.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How do we avoid having to deal with that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is the other problem. All of the hostiles are permanently within The Link, and as such as soon as any of them see any of us, everyone else will be instantly alerted. &nbsp; Even if we were to incapacitate them before they had any conscious awareness of us, their sudden drop from The Link would alert the entire station to our presence all the same.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t those internal sensors detect our presence as soon as we step onto the station?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ordinarily yes, which is why we&rsquo;ll all be wearing these.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bill reached into the shadow of the wall and withdrew small pendants with what appeared to be a red ruby at its heart and passed them out. &nbsp; Kathryn was pleased to discover that merely pressing it into her shirt kept it securely there.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Red&rsquo;s not really my colour,&rdquo; Margaret complained, but assuming she was joking everyone ignored her and she pressed it into her clothing all the same. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ralph&rsquo;s internal hardware has been programmed to generate the same field these will,&rdquo; Bill explained as he reached back into the wall and handed out the same devices to his Bobbin compatriots. &nbsp;&ldquo;These will make you invisible to the internal sensors of the station. &nbsp; However, it offers no defence against visual detection. &nbsp;If any of the hostiles see you they will not help. &nbsp;Also, any interior space of the station can have visual scanners activated if alerted to a problem, but they are not left on continuously.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ve got all that,&rdquo; Kathryn offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big station,&rdquo; Bill explained, &ldquo;and only ten hostiles. &nbsp;Having access to their internal scanners makes it relatively easy to avoid encountering any of them, but this one is our problem, here.&rdquo; &nbsp;With his spindly finger he pointed to one particular purple triangle. &nbsp;&ldquo;This target is permanently stationed at the primary Link Hub access point we need to reach. &nbsp; We might try bubbling through the ship to the rear of the terminal and tapping into the station from behind the wall, but I suspect it would detect our activity from the screens it was monitoring. &nbsp;I believe we will instead need to incapacitate him and access the console manually. &nbsp; There is also the issue of needing to break the encryption if we try to tap it from behind, if we take the target, it will already have unlocked the console for us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But you said that if we take it out that would automatically alert the ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, I did&hellip; &nbsp; There is one possibility but it is risky.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well out with it then,&rdquo; Margaret uttered, frustrated at the cryptic non-suggestion.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is theoretically possible, that if we monitor the signals coming to and from that Bobbin for several minutes, we could augment one of us sufficiently to Link into their network and avert any alert. &nbsp;It is risky thought.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;For one, it might not work,&rdquo; he explained. &nbsp;We might be visually detected before we could attempt it, or we could make the attempt and the simulation would be incomplete or take too long to establish and we would be detected either way. &nbsp;Nothing like it has ever actually been attempted.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Can</em> it work?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill looked back at the large screen before him. &nbsp;If he had a chin Kathryn could imagine him stroking it contemplatively. &nbsp; &ldquo;I believe it to be our best chance of success, but I believed you deserved to know the risks.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I appreciate that. &nbsp;What else do we need to know?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;While they had been discussing the plan, Jaren had been establishing a bridge between his scroll and the enemy station through their ship. &nbsp;He was following along for the most part, looking up path through the station, schematics on the tactical drones they were likely to encounter, and other areas of interest on the ship. &nbsp;Finally the green square in the schematic of the ship was sufficient to draw his attention.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Prisoner&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered quietly to himself as he continued to investigate. &nbsp;Maybe a Bobbin prisoner Bill might be interested in? &nbsp; Looking further he saw that adjacent there was a large piece of hardware which looked oddly familiar, and in the enhanced schematic he could see data conduits going from it to the primary data core of the ship&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn interrupted Bill when she saw her husband had turned utterly pale white as blood drained from his face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jaren!?&rdquo; she said as she came over to steady her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <em>here</em>!&rdquo; he croaked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What? &nbsp; Who&rsquo;s here?&rsquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Maggie</em>!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he took control of the wall view screen and put up an image of the inside of the prisoner suite he&rsquo;d been able to render.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He was right, there she was, lying on one of the beds made out of the material of the station. &nbsp;She was wearing the same clothes as she was when she&rsquo;d been captured two months ago (?) and looked like she hadn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to bathe in as much time. &nbsp; She was unconscious, only sleeping they could only hope, but there she was, alive at least. &nbsp;The room view automatically projected to the side of the green square completely around her a medical readout. &nbsp;The text they couldn&rsquo;t understand, but the steady rhythm of two of the readings were unmistakably a heartbeat and breathing rate.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh my god&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn said, putting her mouth over her hand. &nbsp;It really was her, and Kathryn was utterly overwhelmed. &nbsp;This was an unexpected opportunity, but it also added an immeasurable additional risk to the mission they were already on.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That is&hellip; unfortunate,&rdquo; Bill uttered through his mirror ball in dismay.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How can you say that?&rdquo; Kathryn demanded angrily. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is the only thing that matters to us!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand that Admiral, but the fate of my entire civilization hangs on the success of this mission already!&rdquo; &nbsp;The mirror ball did a pretty good job of translating his rising anger in the voice synthesis.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving without her,&rdquo; Kathryn declared coldly, leaving no room for uncertainty in her commitment to that fact.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Bill said with a lowering of the intensity in his simulated voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;That, is why it is unfortunate. &nbsp;This mission just became far more challenging, and it was already not guaranteed to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Especially since our exit strategy included obliterating that station,&rdquo; Margaret growled. &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey wait, did you know!?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>Of course not!</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;The synthesis of his voice from the mirror ball again appropriately translated his anger, but this time the ferocity of his voice was felt through their feet as his infrasonic voice roared at them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The Bobbin and Margaret glared at each other heatedly for a few moments before they mutually disarmed their hostility gradually.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Given this new information I would not expect you to feel any differently,&rdquo; Bill finally said. &nbsp;&ldquo;But we need a new plan. &nbsp;If we are detected in our access of the central core, it will be difficult enough merely escaping with our lives, let alone rescuing your daughter. &nbsp;We need a means more certain to proceed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We could prioritize the rescue,&rdquo; Jaren offered, &ldquo;figure out some other way to infiltrate the enemy Link?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I assure you this is equally as impossible as abandoning your daughter,&rdquo; Bill reassured them coldly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; Ralph said. &nbsp;Everyone in the room looked over at him at once, nearly having forgotten he was even there.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Bill encouraged him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your best option was to transfer the active link of the enemy at the computer core to one of your compatriots.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There are two problems with this. &nbsp;One, the friendly unavoidably has its own mind and it would be extremely challenging to fool the local Link in this way. &nbsp;Two, to make your escape, this link would need to be severed, leading to immediate detection, and the impossibility of a second objective of rescue.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo; Jaren asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I believe I can more effectively serve as the simulated Link node.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill and the other Bobbins immediately began furiously debating amongst themselves in tones that were only occasionally audible when of a high enough pitch.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What would that mean for you?&rdquo; Jaren asked while they debated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;As an artificial intelligence I am designed to simulate a consciousness. &nbsp;By losing my own identity I can instead simulate an alternate mind, such as the one connected to the Link. &nbsp;As Bill suggested earlier, by recording the signals to and from a target Bobbin for several minutes I could then simulate the node activity of that particular individual. &nbsp;For how long this deception would be unnoticed would depend on how much time signal activity had been recorded in advance.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And what happens to you?&rdquo; Margaret asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I, as a conscious identity, would cease to exist.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Margaret pleaded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked at her curiously before asking the robot, &ldquo;how do you feel about that prospect?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unknown,&rdquo; it answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was created for one purpose, and having failed that purpose, I fulfilled my backup objective. &nbsp;Since then I have existed&hellip; without any ultimate mission. &nbsp;I have been entertained accompanying you, but the prospect of continuing to exist, or&hellip; ceasing to, neither seem particularly impactful to me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But Ralph,&rdquo; Margaret pleaded, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re alive. &nbsp;You think and feel, that&rsquo;s something worth cherishing regardless of the circumstances. &nbsp;You have a body now, you could be ageless&hellip; like me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Now Kathryn understood. &nbsp;As much as she teased and derided this poor robot, she felt a kinship with it. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been alone in her kind for centuries, the last surviving simulant among humans. &nbsp;Sure she got along fine with humans&hellip; most of the time, but she knew in her heart or wherever as a simulant that she was not one of them, that she was forever and irredeemably apart from human beings. &nbsp;Ralph was the first being she&rsquo;d sensed any kinship with in that way in over five hundred years. &nbsp;Him being so casually willing to end his own existence not only frightened her at the sudden sense of loneliness she&rsquo;d suddenly realized she&rsquo;d feel, but being so casually dismissive of his own existence cast a dismissive light on her own existence which profoundly disturbed her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not his fault,&rdquo; Bill gently offered, having adequately conferred with his teammates. &nbsp; We constructed his type of intelligence to be totally at peace with their own demise, not to seek it, but to be undisturbed by it. &nbsp;The very nature of the mission they are programmed with requires in the end the end of themselves. &nbsp;Without that trait their existence would be painful. &nbsp;It does not seek its own end,&rdquo; he explained as he rested his spindly hand on his frame, &ldquo;but it is pleased to find a meaningful purpose in its end. &nbsp; Perhaps that is why it has been so happy to follow you along since being relieved of its purpose, to find a way such as this to meaningfully complete its existence.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret said nothing else, but slinked back and folded her arms, leaning against a wall with an embittered and hurt expression Kathryn wasn&rsquo;t sure she&rsquo;d ever quite seen her put on before.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Whatever else may be the case,&rdquo; Bill offered, &ldquo;this option stands the best chance of success, and the best option for our mission to be an overall success.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;With that, the mission was set. &nbsp;They would advance to the central core and use Ralph to usurp the Link and gain access to the node. &nbsp;They would copy all of the contents of the Link since the war had started (all previous data would be the same as their own), and then make for Maggie on their way back to the ship. &nbsp;Despite the interior of the station being variable, there were corridors between relevant sections of the ship for emergency access in the event of a failure in the shape shifting systems. &nbsp;The first thing they would do once they accessed the central core was sabotage the shift system so that at the first sign of trouble they could deactivate it. &nbsp; The measure would not last long, but as long as it did it would secure their passage as well as inhibit the formation of tactical drones.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They all geared up in their own unique ways. &nbsp;The Bobbins seemed to generally ready themselves in similar ways but there were distinctions amongst them. &nbsp;They all wore a metallic armour which seemed more ceremonial than functional given the power of the weapons they were up against. &nbsp;She also imagined that if they were an effective defence against the wand weapons they would be shared with the humans. &nbsp;It covered the front of their lower section and the front of their forward legs, and supported a short distance back of their full length, long enough for a shield to be seated which came up to protect their central projection where their eyes were.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They also appeared to have smeared colours on parts of their central projections which seemed remarkably like some kind of war paint. &nbsp;Millions of years old, thousands of light years away could these aliens really have smeared war paint on their face before going into battle? &nbsp; If so Kathryn believed she had either seriously underestimated their sense of honour and/or tradition, or how peaceful a people they were really ordinarily inclined to be.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;They also varied in how they were armed. &nbsp;Bill and another were simply armed with a wand on either side of their lower section between their front and rear legs, while having what appeared to be a small ceremonial dagger mounted in a sheath to the front of their lower section. &nbsp; Another had four wands mounted on its armour as though it were a living mobile tank, while another merely held a single wand in its hands, also equipped with the small dagger, but much more dangerous looking swords mounted in a cross from the sides of the base of its central projection, crossing behind it and extending back between its rear legs.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn had thought some time ago that her ability to be surprised had been exhausted, but seeing these otherworldly creatures ready themselves for battle was at once the most eerily familiar sight, as well as the most alien thing she had seen so far in all of her adventures to date. &nbsp;She was left speechless at the sight.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As for herself and Jaren, both had merely acquired two of the wands and hung them on either side of their waist. &nbsp;Ralph clutched a single wand in one hand, but Margaret seemed in a state none had seen her before. &nbsp;Seemingly taking a note from their hosts, she had dirtied her hair with what Kathryn couldn&rsquo;t imagine, but she&rsquo;d also smeared dark paint all over her exposed skin like the Bobbins. &nbsp;She always wore dark clothes accented with dark scarlet and she was left looking just as otherworldly as the Bobbins. &nbsp;In the context of the dull black walls of the shuttle she appeared ghostly, noticeably darkened to the point that she could indeed be missed if not looked directly at. &nbsp; The dark scarlet notes of her clothes seemed to glint as she moved and she had a darkly grim expression of determination Kathryn had never seen in her before.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Apparently having familiarized herself with the replicating function of the wall, like the one Bobbin she had likewise fashioned herself two thin but meter long swords, gently curved and the same dull black as the shifting material of the craft. &nbsp;As Kathryn observed them crossed each other on her back, it suddenly struck her that she might not have been taking cues from the Bobbins, but that it was entirely possible that they had gotten these ideas from the simulant. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t sure she wanted to know, but Margaret seemed more appropriately teamed with the aliens than she was with the humans, unmodified as they were themselves.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;And then, it was time.</p>
