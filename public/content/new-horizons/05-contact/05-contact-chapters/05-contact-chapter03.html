            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Elsewhere in the station, Kathryn opened the door to the Earth Ancient Technologies Research Institute, known more commonly by the acronym EATRI. &nbsp;It was here that the technology of Earth before the plague was studied and efforts made to replicate the technology for themselves. &nbsp; Like every other Terran research institute, it was a laboratory run jointly by the three colony worlds, but this one happened to be headed by one of Kathryn&rsquo;s oldest and closest friends, Felix Parker, a born engineer who had been with her on their initial mission to Eartha all those years ago.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Electromagnetism based technologies and basic rocketry were things Kathryn&rsquo;s people had rediscovered for themselves before making contact with the other more advanced colonies, and they had even since developed some technologies which far exceeded that which Earth themselves had developed before the plague, such as antimatter based technologies as well as the rift technology which harvested the power of a star to force open a rift between a complementary gateway around another star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Some technologies however, were things which had been lost, things which the colonies had all forgotten how to use and create, and which they never found the impetus to redevelop again for themselves. &nbsp;Primary amongst them, was Brainchip technology which allowed the use of technology effortlessly with thought control, and simulant technology which allowed the perfect duplication of a human which was a feat of both artificial intelligence engineering as well as synthetic human bodies indistinguishable from a genuine human.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;While Kobol was by far the most technologically advanced, their cultural beliefs about the sacredness of the body inhibited them being driven in an appropriate research direction to develop these technologies, but now having learned of their possibilities and potential, were as onboard as the other worlds to rediscover these lost technologies. &nbsp;They were making slow but steady progress in both, thought the simulants were a much longer journey of research and discovery.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn again found herself a little overwhelmed by the clutter and seeming chaos of the laboratory. &nbsp;In her office and in the operations centre, she insisted on a certain degree of tidiness and organization, but Felix operated in a completely different way, at least in his professional sphere. &nbsp;He insisted it was necessary to the creative process and she understood to a degree, it was after all as much an experimental fabrication shop as it was a proper scientific laboratory.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Dammit Felix&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered as she tripped over something cylindrical and metallic.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Kathryn!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed. &nbsp;He was wearing a multiple lens magnifying device over one ear with a strap going around his head to hold in tin place as he worked on something at this workbench. &nbsp; He pulled it off and dropped it on the counter to come give her a hug. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to check this out&hellip;&rdquo; he said as he drew her over to his workbench, upon which lay something which resembled the general configuration of a human being, but was clearly made of artificial materials.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s a robot, it&rsquo;s our latest prototype.&rdquo; &nbsp;He seemed a little insulted that it wasn&rsquo;t more obvious to her what it was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bah. &nbsp; You call that a robot?&rdquo; a surly old woman chided as she came around a corner and walked towards them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Margaret, how are you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still sick of being trapped in here. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m this close to flying the coop again.&rdquo; &nbsp;She held out her thumb and forefinger very near to each other to show how close she was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret was a simulant, the last one in existence from before the plague, now nearly seven hundred years old. &nbsp;When they&rsquo;d found her barely surviving on Earth on their expedition they&rsquo;d made a deal with her for information and in the process discovered a new unused simulant body in a hardened transport case in the ruins of the laboratory she&rsquo;d originally been built in. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her original body had been that of an old woman, but the one they&rsquo;d found was of an elderly one, which quickly seemed wildly appropriate given her true age, and her personality had grown into her body somewhat in the intervening years. &nbsp; Her gratitude for them saving her from her certain fate kept her here for them to study, which explained their remarkably rapid progress having a working model to study, but she often felt like an imprisoned lab rat. &nbsp;She periodically left unannounced, as she was free to, but they never knew when she was coming back though she always did eventually.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&hellip; I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement considering,&rdquo; Felix said a little defensively.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh sure it is, but it&rsquo;s always going to pale compared to me. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got a long way to go still,&rdquo; she scolded with a laugh.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Margaret&rsquo;s technology was originally designed to not exceed the capabilities of a human being so as to even fool herself if she didn&rsquo;t already know she were a simulant. &nbsp; Included in this was the built in equivalent of the Brainchip system, though just a much simpler transmitter linked to her quantum brain. &nbsp;The original was three grain of rice sized devices implanted in key areas of the brain. &nbsp; Having her to study her equivalent system was also very helpful to the institute in their work on Brainchips.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Does it do anything other than lie there?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Felix, playfully joining in on Margaret&rsquo;s ribbing.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh hell, you too? &nbsp;Of course it does!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &nbsp;He feigned exasperation, but only the extent of it to hide his sincere sense of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix held one of the Kobol multi-function wands to the neck of the machine the screen on the front of its head flickered before revealing a face which then opened its eyes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Felix&hellip; you put your husband&rsquo;s face on it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix just shrugged with a clipped laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who else&rsquo;s face was I supposed to put on it?&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn rolled her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright P4, get on up off the bench. &nbsp;Show them what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;P4?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Fourth prototype,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ahh.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The robot was quite humanoid in form, with well-defined legs and arms. &nbsp;Different long components and cover panels on it were either a muted shiny silver or dull crosshatched black material. &nbsp;The most inhuman part was the head which was essentially a cylinder with a display screen wrapped all the way around it perpetually trying to give the effect of looking at that side of the head from whatever angle you looked at it but never quite succeeding.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It sat up on the bench, gripped the side of it and swung its legs over the side and down. &nbsp; It then carefully pushed itself down over the edge and fell the short distance to landing its feet on the ground. &nbsp; It wobbled for a moment then steadied itself. &nbsp;It stood up straight reaching a little under two meters tall in height, then looked at Felix and asked: &ldquo;How can I serve?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Just go and walk around the office for us P4, ummm&hellip; go over to the end of the lab there and pick up that microscope and bring it here alright?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; it said before turning and walking towards the other end of the room.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Felix asked the two women.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It reminds me of a droid from the old days&hellip; a really slow, really dumb droid. &nbsp;So definitely an improvement on P3.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;P4 reached the other end of the room, slowly grasped the microscope, turned around with it, then promptly dropped it on the ground with a terrible crashing sound of breaking glass. &nbsp;Felix put his face in his palm and rubbed his brow, slowly shook his head as it stepped on the microscope to a crunching sound while still miming holding it in its hand.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Then again&hellip;&rdquo; Margaret reconsidered, tilting her head to the side, &ldquo;maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Two hundred years Earth was working on robotics before they created you,&rdquo; Felix scolded. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had fifteen years, give me a break. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re still making great progress.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What about the brain?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;The quantum computer brain Margaret ran on was the third primary research area studied here.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;P4 still has traditional circuitry. &nbsp;Before we got to Earth I didn&rsquo;t even know there was such a thing as quantum mechanics, but the Kobolians are quite familiar with it. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve just never tried to use it in quite that way before. &nbsp; They can build the computer part, but the simulation software is harder. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll take years and years of more and more refining ever more complicated and sophisticated programming to the point where it&rsquo;s a mind that seems human in every conceivable way. &nbsp;Once we have that down though it&rsquo;s just a question of adjusting personality variables</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;P4 wasn&rsquo;t built as an artificial intelligence prototype though, he&rsquo;s primarily just a robotics demonstrator.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; Margaret stated dryly with a wry smile on her face as P4 presented an imaginary microscope to him. &nbsp;As much as she could sometimes come to loathe being so carefully studied, she did love moments like this, and how many years and research hours had already gone into such pathetic attempts to replicate the glory that was her. &nbsp;If nothing she was never without cause to feel good about herself here.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Just&hellip; get back on the work bench,&rdquo; Felix ordered it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As it turned around, backed up to the bench, put its arms out onto the edge of the workbench and lifted itself up before swinging its legs around over the flat smooth surface, Felix asked Margaret what brought her here. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t need a reason, but coming to the laboratory suggested a professional reason.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well I-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>BANG BANG BANG&nbsp;</em>from elsewhere in the lab</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I-&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG</em></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;HEY!!&rdquo; Felix called over to the tech who was making all the noise. &nbsp;&ldquo;Take five would you??&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sorry boss,&rdquo; the researcher called back. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take five then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix gave a nod with a sarcastically incredulous look on his face before turning back to Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We got our first message back from all the rift ship the Kobolians sent out yesterday.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Felix marvelled. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fantastic! &nbsp;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sixty-one Cygnus, a binary system of K-types about eleven and a half light years away.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Margaret remarked. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to need a much better name for it than that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn let out a little laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any signs of life?&rdquo; Felix asked. &nbsp;There was life in the three systems the colonies had travelled to, but that was known beforehand and why they had gone there in the first place. &nbsp;Haven itself had even showed evidence of a land cephalopod species capable of rudimentary electronics technology which had since changed to a less developed form due to co-evolution with a devastating brain parasite.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Sadly no&hellip; but there is a planet which looks like it could support life but it just never happened, similar mass, atmosphere, and temperature as Earth, but just like if life had never happened here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s too bad, but the chance to study a planet like that would be very interesting all its own.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren and I pulled some strings to be able to command the mission ourselves to get out there like we used to and do some real research and exploration.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Felix laughed. &nbsp; &ldquo;Really! &nbsp;Well good for you, you deserve it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I could really use a good engineer, Felix.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh! &nbsp;Oh you mean&hellip; well yeah, that sounds great! &nbsp;I mean I&rsquo;ll have to check with Taj, but yeah I don&rsquo;t see why not. &nbsp;Oh it&rsquo;d be great to get away for a few months, see a new system.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good to hear.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa,&rdquo; Margaret said. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you too are going on some kind of adventure, no way I&rsquo;m sticking around here. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m coming with you too.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to Margaret, but like I told my daughter, it&rsquo;s no vacation cruise. &nbsp;You come along you&rsquo;ll be crew, expected to pull your own weight and go on the duty roster like everyone else.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right now, different is better. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got to get out of here, especially if Felix won&rsquo;t be here. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine how unbearable this place would be without him. &nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hey thanks Margaret, that&rsquo;s very nice of you to say.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You should bring your dummy too.&rdquo; she countered in reference to P4, deliberately blunting her kindness. &nbsp;Felix looked down on the robot and sighed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You should Felix,&rdquo; Kathryn advised. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a lot of down time in transit for you to work on him.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright&hellip; hey, what ship are we taking?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the best part! &nbsp;New Horizon II has been retasked to us. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be here in two weeks, so you have that long to get ready.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted a good look at that ship, it&rsquo;s supposed to be something pretty special!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;From what I understand, it is. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll always have a soft spot for the original, but I&rsquo;m very impressed with what this new one is supposed to be able to do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll only take ten days to get here from the Haven&rsquo;s outer binary giants.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo; Felix marvelled at the ship&rsquo;s speed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Kathryn pressed her finger to the work bench. &nbsp;&ldquo;Two weeks. &nbsp;Talk it over with Taj and get back to me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in either way,&rdquo; Margaret declared.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good to hear,&rdquo; Kathryn stated as she turned to leave. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you two later then.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;</p>
