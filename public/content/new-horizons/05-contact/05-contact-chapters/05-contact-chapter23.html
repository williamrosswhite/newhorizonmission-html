            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As her crew got to work stripping themselves of the precious anti-matter, Kathryn and Jaren went to their quarters to gather up the things they would need to take with them. &nbsp; This was not a difficult task, after all they had only intended to be on this ship for a relatively short time and had not brought that much with them. &nbsp;After packing up their own things, they then both went to Maggie&rsquo;s suite and began somberly packing up her things as well.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It was an act of faith. &nbsp;Both knew full well that there was every chance that she was not only dead, but dissected and preserved in a large number of specimen jars, or whatever else these aliens might to if they were so maliciously inclined. &nbsp;They were quiet as they did so, both concerned that if they got to talking they would only wind up crying and become temporarily incapacitated. &nbsp; When they had packed up everything they could find of hers for her, Jaren finally took hold of Kathryn and brought her into a full and forceful hug. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As he did so her mental barriers fell and she began sobbing. &nbsp;She had teared up before over this, but never outright sobbed before. &nbsp; She&rsquo;d been with other men in her life, and the rare sobbing she&rsquo;d felt compelled to she&rsquo;d kept private and secret, seeing it perhaps as some kind of weakness she didn&rsquo;t want to expose of herself. &nbsp; It had happened only a handful of times since she&rsquo;d been with Jaren, but they&rsquo;d been together long enough that he had seen the best and worst of her. &nbsp;There was no longer any chance of her exposing any weakness in a way which he might harm or use against her. &nbsp;She trusted him completely, and had complete emotional security with him, and he was the only man she&rsquo;d ever felt that way about by a significant measure.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When she composed herself enough to notice, she realized that Jaren had been sobbing just as intently as she had been, and with equal disregard for how it might look or show about him. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d lost their daughter, and despite how long it had been since, it was the first time they&rsquo;d allowed themselves complete surrender to that fact. &nbsp;Almost as though they&rsquo;d coordinated it, when they pulled away from each other they wiped the tears from each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get her back,&rdquo; Jaren determined.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Damn right we will.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After having themselves a good night&rsquo;s sleep which never would have been possible under the circumstances without help from the chief medical officer&rsquo;s cabitnet of wonders, it was time to disembark for the last time. &nbsp;While they slept, every last atom of anti-matter was assembled into transfer pods and handed over to the Bobbins, who no doubt made very short work of weaponizing the material. &nbsp;By the time Kathryn and Jaren had awoken, showered, and had some breakfast (which reminded them they should bring some human ration packs in case they couldn&rsquo;t or didn&rsquo;t want to eat whatever the Bobbins might offer them for food), their new ship was staffed, armed and ready to go.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;It approached just as the original one they&rsquo;d met after they&rsquo;d emerged in this system out of the portal. &nbsp;Kathryn, Jaren, Margaret, and Ralph all waited by the airlock with their equipment and packed belongings, accompanied only by Felix to see them off. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As he watched the ship approach through the docking port windows Felix asked, &ldquo;you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to come along with you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Love you too,&rdquo; Kathryn answered, &ldquo;but I need you here more.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Un hunh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Again the wall of the alien ship dematerialized at the docking port to allow access to the interior of the ship. &nbsp;No Bobbin came out to greet them, it seemed the open door was the only formal invitation they&rsquo;d receive.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Come on Ralph, make yourself useful,&rdquo; Margaret said as she started loading the robot&rsquo;s arms up with the bags and equipment of the others.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That might be too much Molly, some of that is sensitive equipment,&rdquo; Jaren cautioned as the simulant overloaded the robot.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;ll be fine&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;When it seemed like he couldn&rsquo;t carry any more, she loaded just one more small item on top of the pile in his arms and stood back to admire her work. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright boy, git,&rdquo; she said with a grin as she smacked his metal equivalent of his ass on his body. &nbsp;The robot carefully began stepping forward, even stepping over the lip on the floor at the airlock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; she assured it as she looked up at the others with a wide grin and followed him in.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; Felix offered as he hugged them each in turn. &nbsp;&ldquo;I look forward to hearing all about it when you get back home.&rdquo; &nbsp; With that he turned to leave, seemingly wanting to get the good bye over with to mask the moisture welling up in his eyes.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kathryn said to Jaren with an encouraging smile as she held her arm out towards the airlock entry, &ldquo;after you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill greeted them on the other side of the airlock, and first showed them to their quarters not far away. &nbsp;The corridors were unremarkable, perfectly flat matt black surfaces except for the ceiling with was entirely one continuous light emitting surface. &nbsp;It was bright enough but seemed a little dull to Kathryn. &nbsp;When they arrived at their quarters, instead of finding a doorway, a door shaped section of the corridor wall simply particalized away like their airlock door, and Kathryn wondered how many unmarked rooms they had passed along the way there.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The door was too short for them, obviously Bobbin sized, and after Bill looked up at them and then back at the door, it enlarged to a size appropriate for the humans. &nbsp; Bill led them in, and once inside he informed them through his mirror ball that their robot could inform them how to operate the suite. &nbsp;He claimed that they were already underway towards the star, but they found this difficult to believe with the absence of a sense of acceleration other than the slightly more than one gee which was keeping them on the floor. &nbsp;He assured them they were, and that once they were situated they should join him in the command room, after all it would not be long until they arrived at the star and the mission would begin. &nbsp;The humans also found this unimaginable considering by their normal means they were still several days from the star.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;When Margaret asked Ralph what Bill meant by &lsquo;operate&rsquo; the suite, he showed them. &nbsp; They immediately came to understand that while the room seemed quite barren and uninteresting, the shape could be easily manipulated into whatever they wished. &nbsp;He showed them how they could pull a slab out of the wall to make a bed, or raise a chair from the ground. &nbsp;He even showed them that they could make the entire wall of the room against the outside transparent into a window. &nbsp;He cautioned them remarkably matter of factly that they should be careful not to make the wall disappear altogether as oppose to render it transparent since one meant a nice view while the other meant sudden death. &nbsp;He explained that there were specific hand gestures against surfaces which could accomplish the effects, but also that the onboard computer had been loaded with the human&rsquo;s language so they could also converse with the computer in English as easily as they could Bill or himself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren stood by the wall window. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. that can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; off in the distance there was a bright disc the size of a small coin held at arm&rsquo;s length. &nbsp;He turned to Ralph. &nbsp;&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be the planet we just left!?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ralph looked out the window and reassured him it was.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jaren said to himself in fluster as he unpacked his portable computer terminal and set it on the bed Ralph had demonstrated the conjuring of and sat beside it. &nbsp;He actually seemed to go pale as he looked up at Kathryn.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;My instruments read that we&rsquo;re in a constant one point two gees, but&hellip;&rdquo; he looked back out the window, refusing to believe it, &ldquo;calculations show that the relative size of that planet suggest that we&rsquo;re pulling away from it at nearly a <em>thousand</em> meters per second squared. &nbsp;Look,&rdquo; he pointed out the window, &ldquo;already it&rsquo;s just a point of light now!&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is this typical?&rdquo; Kathryn asked Ralph with a look of concern.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, this is standard transit speed for a vessel this small.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well I guess you two just set some kind of record,&rdquo; Margaret offered to the Kathryn and Jaren as she pulled a cigar out and lit it lovingly.<br>&nbsp;</p>
