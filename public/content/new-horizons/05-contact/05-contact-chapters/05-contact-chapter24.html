        <div class="text-left">
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, want to give us a tour of the ship?&rdquo; Jaren asked Ralph.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is not much to see,&rdquo; the robot answered plainly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Most of the volume of this ship is void space, low density matter ready to be configured according to need. &nbsp;As it exists presently there is no much defined interior. &nbsp;I would remind you that ships such as these frequently operate with no crew at all, and in such operation require no internal structure whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even imagine what kind of technology could be at work here&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn marvelled.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And they say there&rsquo;s no such thing as magic,&rdquo; Margaret remarked dryly as she studied the lit tip of her cigar, and the smoke curling up from it. &nbsp;She watched as it was pulled directly into the wall by means she couldn&rsquo;t fathom.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn stated firmly. &nbsp;&ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t fully understand gravity. &nbsp;It stands to reason that if we did, we could infer these same technologies.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah, and any number of other things we haven&rsquo;t figured out we don&rsquo;t anything about yet,&rdquo; Margaret responded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We should get to the bridge&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren offered with hesitation, &ldquo;or whatever they call it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Put your hand on the wall and say &lsquo;Command&rsquo;&rdquo; Ralph instructed him. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren followed his instructions, and the first thing they noticed was that the window melted away to be replaced once again with seemingly solid ethereal dark matter. &nbsp; A few moment later a doorway appeared in the wall as it had before, but this time on the other side was a larger room with several Bobbins seemingly hard at work, conversing in their nauseating ultra-low frequency language.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Did&hellip; the <em>room</em> just move?&rdquo; Kathryn asked, amazed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Like some sort of&hellip; bubble through the ship?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; &nbsp; Kathryn put this marvel upon marvels aside, and stepped into the Command room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bill?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As one of the creatures approached her, a sphere of material blobbed out of the wall and assumed a chrome finish on its exterior surface as it approached. &nbsp;She wondered if the mirror ball had been waiting in the matter of the ship, or if it had actually been created anew out of the material.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it said, looking at her seemingly askance. &nbsp;When he looked at her, his two of his three offset eyes always seemed to be looking at her sideways. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are nearing the portal. &nbsp;We must be ready.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If all goes according to plan, we should be able to broadcast our identity as friendly and approach the station without detection. &nbsp;Once we dock we will board the station. &nbsp;We will make our way to the link core and once in physical contact any of us can directly download the data to our own internal Link system. &nbsp;We will then share it amongst ourselves in case any of us should fall. &nbsp;The breach will be immediately detected so we will have to fight our way back to the ship, and from the ship fight our way out of the system. &nbsp;There should not be a large crew on the station, this is in our favour. &nbsp;We expect no more than a dozen Bobbins, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Tactical drones can be fabricated out of the material about us as easily as this communications device.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;We have a countermeasure, we can generate a field which inhibits any manipulation of matter within the field, but at several points we will need to disengage it to make our egress</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see. &nbsp; Well we didn&rsquo;t bring any weapons with us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know. &nbsp; We have a little over an hour until we reach the portal. &nbsp;That should give us enough time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Weapons training.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill touched his hand against the wall where the doorway to their room had been and said something in his own language. &nbsp;The same doorway appeared, but beyond it was a large cavernous space. &nbsp;As they stepped through, the dull black material lightened in shade as it began emitting enough light from every surface to be able to see clearly.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He reached into the wall and pulled out an object which was about three decimeters long. &nbsp; It was a long rectangular prism less than two decimeters on the short side. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is&hellip; again, proper names are problematic. &nbsp;It is a weapon, do you have a name you would suggest for it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn looked over the object which was the dame dull primer black colour as everything else on the ship. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, a&hellip; wand?&rdquo; she suggested inquisitively, looking back at her team. &nbsp; They shrugged disinterestedly in approval.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Bill accepted, &ldquo;a wand then. &nbsp;It emits a bolt of energy which on lower energy settings is invisible, but at higher energy settings is visible as it ignites the oxygen in the atmosphere it passes through. &nbsp;The technology is not entirely dissimilar to the weapon of Ralph&rsquo;s ship when you encountered it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and her crew nodded their understanding.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is no front or back, it will always shoot away from the user. &nbsp;It is squeeze operated, and the stronger you squeeze the device, the stronger the bolt will be as a result. &nbsp;Observe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;An ill-defined homunculus of a Bobbin grew out of the ground, and Bill shot it with the wand on low power. &nbsp;The only indication of the hit was the target briefly flashing purple to indicate a hit. &nbsp; It burst purple most brightly between where the eyes would be, and with a dissipated brightness radiating away.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;On high power however,&rdquo; Bill shot again and the target utterly blew apart into innumerable pieces and showered down onto the ground. &nbsp;All of the pieces were absorbed into the ground, and reformed back up into the original target.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bill handed the wand he had been holding to Kathryn, and then reached into the wall to grab more for the others. &nbsp;&ldquo;On full power the bolt will penetrate the walls a meter or two, but this room has moved to the very interior of the ship and there are no adjacent rooms or equipment for three meters on either side, so your practicing should be safe as long as you do not fire repeatedly on the same location in rapid succession on full power.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Having handed wands to Margaret and Jaren, Bill opened a doorway to a small empty transfer room which would presumably bubble him back away to command. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suggest you practice. &nbsp;I will come for you when we arrive at the portal.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Before he could close the wall again, Kathryn spoke up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bill, will we&hellip; are we expected to kill others of your kind?&rdquo; &nbsp; She was asking if they were permitted to but she felt more comfortable framing the question that way instead.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Many have died already on both sides.&rdquo; &nbsp;Kathryn felt as though she were beginning to be able to read his expression and the tone of his words now, even though she was hearing his voice through his ever-present mirror ball. &nbsp;His tone seemed to take on a remarkably dark note as he spoke. &nbsp;&ldquo;It should be sufficient to stun on this mission, but death is not forbidden.&rdquo; &nbsp;The door closed as he said the words, not allowing any further discussion on the subject.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Death is not forbidden&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn repeated as she looked back at her team.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Truer words were never spoken,&rdquo; Margaret remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Kathryn refocused them, &ldquo;well let&rsquo;s get some practice in then. &nbsp;Kind of reminds me of the wands you Kobolians developed,&rdquo; she remarked to her husband. &nbsp;When she had first met him, she had marvelled at a tool he used which could be used as a mechanical tool at a short distance, or a weapon for rendering targets unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Jaren remarked as he looked it over, &ldquo;but this seems to only be a weapon, and much more powerful. &nbsp;Ralph please call up half a dozen targets and have them move around at a speed and patter appropriate to the Bobbins we&rsquo;ll encounter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Without a word Ralph obeyed, and six shadowy figures emerged up out of the ground and began moving about the chamber in and amongst them.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Uhh, for now let&rsquo;s just have them down range okay? &nbsp;We may have to practice that later, but right now I&rsquo;d really like to avoid us shooting each other.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The figures moved over to the far end of the room and continued moving about. &nbsp;Jaren held out his arm, aiming the wand as he trained on one particular figure. &nbsp;He shot, but missed, and the radiating purple light from the central strike showed on the wall behind. &nbsp;Kathryn smiled at him as she in one motion reached out, extended the wand, and shot one of the figures in the head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Show off&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren muttered with a feigned grumble. &nbsp;Kathryn was a formally trained military officer, while Jaren&rsquo;s background was as a diplomat and earlier in his life an engineer.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Always trying to one up the humans, Margaret spun the wand with a gentle toss up, turned her back to the targets and shot over her shoulder, exploding one of the moving targets after an orange bolt of energy ripped through the air towards it. &nbsp; It rained back down to the ground, absorbed into the ground and was reformed, rejoining the other figures.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn glared at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;You need to take this more seriously. &nbsp;Tell me, did you intend to fire at full power?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright, let me try&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;She squeezed harder while aiming, not as hard as she could, but what she considered fairly firmly. &nbsp;The entire target lit up and stopped for a moment before dulling again and resuming its motion amongst the others. &nbsp;The bolt of energy made a faint orange glow as it travelled from the tip of the wand, but nowhere near as dramatically as when Margaret had shot. &nbsp;&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll call that a kill shot&hellip;&rdquo; she thought to herself and then tried again, squeezing essentially as hard as she could. &nbsp;As when Margaret had shot, a bright orange bolt ripped through the air, but this time she missed and it exploded the wall behind the targets. &nbsp;It took several moment for the wall to reform itself again.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren gave her a look which said &lsquo;now who&rsquo;s the hot shot?&rsquo;. &nbsp;He concentrated as he aimed and squeezed hard, producing a bright bolt and exploded target.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Less than an hour later Bill came to retrieve them and brought them to the command room. &nbsp; They all watched through the transparent wall as they approached the portal cube and seemed to fly directly into it. &nbsp; Kathryn held her breath as the wall hit her, and exhaled once she had emerged out the other side. &nbsp;As they flew away from the star all she could see was the inky blackness out ahead of them. &nbsp;As she studied the blackness, she thought she could make out any number of ships out there. &nbsp;It was too easy for her imagination to see countless ships out there, black as they were against the blackness of space.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Broadcasting our message,&rdquo; Bill reported.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What are you telling them?&rdquo; Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This ship was programmed to make a detailed survey of a newly accessed star system. &nbsp; We are reporting that a calamity struck that system, and that the ship is returning to port as instructed in such a scenario.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What clamity?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;A rogue stellar body flying through the system along the planetary plane either swallowing or deflecting away most of the planets. &nbsp;I am reporting that we did what study we could of this phenomenon and are reporting back to base early.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they buy it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They have. &nbsp; We are clear.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That was too easy,&rdquo; Jaren suggested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Bill said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Our plan worked.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It just&hellip; feels eerie. &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t they tell that there are people on the ship?</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The plainness of his answer didn&rsquo;t sit well with Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;Explain please.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We cannot scan the interior of other ships. &nbsp;We rely on internal sensors reporting to us. &nbsp;We are currently sending false readings indicating that this is an unoccupied ship.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I see. &nbsp; Well, what now?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now we wait. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll take approximately four hours to reach the base in orbit around the second planet. &nbsp; We will proceed as soon as we arrive. &nbsp; You may occupy yourself however you like in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<p style='text-align:center;'>*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Two hours later, about the time the ship would begin decelerating from their speed which seemed utterly ludicrous to the New Horizon II crew, the four were back in their fashioned room. &nbsp;Jaren was working with Ralph to create a bridge and translation matrix between his medium scroll and the alien systems, and was meeting with some success. &nbsp;He was already able to manipulate the material of the ship at a distance with touch inputs on his scroll. &nbsp;They were now working on tapping the scroll directly into the Bobbin Link system to access the font of data it contained. &nbsp;He wanted the capacity in any case, but his rationale was that the relevant data could be stored on his scroll as well as an additional redundant back up. &nbsp;The problem with this, which he had no intention of figuring out how to solve since it was just an excuse, was that the scroll had very limited data storage onboard, being designed to function within a wirelessly networked environment.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn was busily engaged with a terminal which had been conjured out of the wall, complete with desk and chair. &nbsp;She was studying everything she could about the Bobbins, especially the seemingly ludicrous rationale for the war. &nbsp;Margaret had conjured up a bouny ball out of the wall, and in between cigar breaks was bouncing the ball against the far wall from the bed she was laying on, letting it bounce up off of the ground and catching it, then repeating. &nbsp;It irritated the others at first, but they soon forgot she was even doing it as they became ever more engrossed in their own work.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It really is over something that dumb&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; Margaret asked between ball throws, only half interested.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The whole war&hellip; apparently the whole whether ones or zeroes came first has been an issue of, well I&rsquo;d say religious contention ever since they first developed digital technology eons ago. &nbsp;Even after they went quantum and computed in more than two states, the issue didn&rsquo;t go away. &nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t been a relevant question for millions of years and they&rsquo;re still happy to kill each other over it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel too superior,&rdquo; Margaret scolded her. &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you what silly things humans used to kill each other over. &nbsp;Millions of people were killed over who&rsquo;s imaginary friend was real.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not much better.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I get that, it just&hellip; still boggles. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d think a species this advanced&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;The older an argument the deeper the conviction, that&rsquo;s how it works. &nbsp;It hasn&rsquo;t been about which state comes first for millions of years. &nbsp;Now it&rsquo;s just about who&rsquo;s right, which tribe is correct.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find something so trivial to be behind such a massive conflict surprising at all. &nbsp;Anything of actual consequence these critters seem more than capable enough of working it out pretty quickly. &nbsp;For them it would <em>have</em> to be something so trivial I would think.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Still&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What worries me more is the whole Link being permanently left on thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;That really creeps me out. &nbsp;I get the appeal of turning on the link periodically, the overwhelming sense of connectedness and oneness with the universe&hellip; thing, if you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;She gave the impression that she herself would not necessarily be into that kind of thing at all. &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;But to just turn off the whole individual part and leave it on indefinitely, to become just one part of the larger mind and utterly lose yourself,&rdquo; she visibly shuddered, &ldquo;no way. &nbsp;Even as an emergency war measure, no way. &nbsp;If I&rsquo;m not me, if me has totally dissolved away, then there are no stakes anymore. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no me to fight over or for anymore. &nbsp;To win that way you&rsquo;ve already lost.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn remarked as she continued to review the information on the screen. &nbsp; &ldquo;It looks like there may be a connection. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s always been a small minority who have challenged the accepted answer on the binary question, but there has also always been a minority who have argued that it would be better to live in the Link permanently. &nbsp;It seems there was always a significant crossover between the movements. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of the source of the connection but there does seem to be one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Maybe the argument over the first binary digit is just a means of bringing about a conflict which required leaving the link on,&rdquo; Jaren offered from his work. &nbsp; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a meaningless debate was exploited for a pretext to something else dramatic and radical.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more right than you know&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Bounce, bounce, catch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are we on the right side?&rdquo; &nbsp;Margaret asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Should we be taking sides at all here?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I share your concerns Molly, but these people so far have been nothing but helpful and generous, and their enemy is the one who attacked us and stole Maggie and the New Horizon II&rsquo;s computer core. &nbsp;I certainly would have preferred to remain neutral and attempt contact with both sides, but things just didn&rsquo;t play out that way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bounce, bounce, catch.</p>
