            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;&hellip;and thus it is my recommendation that we get in this fight. &nbsp;Now understanding the threat, it is clear to me that the collective is now aware of us and aware of our weapons technology, and that it is only a matter of time before they do something about it. &nbsp;If we wait, we risk the friendly Bobbins being taken out before we can ally ourselves with them and have any hope of defending ourselves when the conflict inevitably arrives at our doorstep. &nbsp;I suggest we ramp up every anti-matter facility any colonies have to maximum output immediately and work with the friendly Bobbins to weaponize it as effectively as possible. &nbsp;Admiral Kathryn Barnes out.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After pressing the control she&rsquo;d been told stopped her recording, she turned around to see Bob quivering behind her at the entrance to the shuttle&rsquo;s command centre.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Not much more we can do I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made as convincing an argument as I can.&rdquo; &nbsp;She then opened a general channel to the ship. &nbsp;&ldquo;All Star Fleet staff report the bridge,&rdquo; she ordered. &nbsp;&ldquo;We will be rifting soon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We will transmit as soon as we cross the event horizon into the Koboli system,&rdquo; Bob said, and Kathryn nodded in acknowledgement as she brought her thumb up to her mouth to chew on it. &nbsp;The tips of Bob&rsquo;s talons on his legs clacked against the shadow matter surface of the floor as he approached her. &nbsp;&ldquo;It appears something is troubling you,&rdquo; it observed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She pulled her thumb away from her mouth reflexively at the observation. &nbsp;&ldquo;I would think that would be obvious. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve stumbled naked ass first into being a key strategic element in a massive galactic internecine war.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve studied you,&rdquo; Bob stated matter of factly. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is something more troubling you, something&hellip; more personal,&rdquo; its mirror ball spoke for him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn sighed and turned towards the window. &nbsp;&ldquo;You should know this is no sure thing. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t guarantee our governments will agree to help you. &nbsp;We can be&hellip; risk averse, xenophobic.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But it is the only logical course of action.&rdquo; &nbsp;It seemed genuinely confused.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn held up her hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to convince me. &nbsp;But if you studied our history you&rsquo;d know we rarely act out of logic or rational self-interest. &nbsp;Honestly we&rsquo;re not great Bob&hellip; she said listlessly as she turned back towards the window and out at the sun which filled the entire field of view as they approached the rift crystal. &nbsp;&ldquo;In fact we downright suck&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She watched as the energy pillars from the solar collectors poured on the crystal and exploded it into a purple cloud.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We shall see soon enough,&rdquo; Bob stated as somberly as it could be conveyed through its mirror ball voice.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The crew shuffled into the command deck, Kathryn and Jaren exchanging cold formal nods of acknowledgement upon his entrance. &nbsp;Little could happen upon transiting to the other system with the time it took to climb their orbit around the sun up to Kobol, but it was protocol they&rsquo;d gotten used to after serving several combined lifetimes in various para-military organizations. &nbsp;Margaret entered last with Ralph in tow which annoyed Kathryn slightly, but she decided to let it go for now.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Count us down when ready please Jaren.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then a few moments later, &ldquo;rift transit in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn felt the now long familiar feeling of the strange existential shudder which came from momentarily being reduced to something less substantial than vapour before feeling normality resume.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Report.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; weird.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jaren said.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There are no ships guarding the crystal,&rdquo; he reported. &nbsp;&ldquo;There a few ships at least monitoring the portal&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Any comms traffic?&rdquo; Kathryn asked. &nbsp;Jaren&rsquo;s hands flew over the controls as information streamed by on the screen in front of him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he said with practiced professionalism which veiled his panic almost completely.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob quivered and turned to his panel which generated controls much better suited to his alien appendages. &nbsp;&ldquo;Admiral Barnes I&rsquo;m picking up what appears to be debris.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A pit of horror birthed in her chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Littered from here towards Kobol, I&rsquo;m reading small pieces of wreckage from human ships, and&hellip;&rdquo; his black eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the information streaming into his brain implants. &nbsp;He turned towards her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Particulate matter consistent with shadow matter coming in contact with anti-matter.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh my God&hellip;&rdquo; Jaren uttered in horror.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;They came&hellip;&rdquo; Kathryn affirmed with wide somber eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;They learned what we had, what we were up to, and they beat us here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is a reasonable conclusion,&rdquo; Bob confirmed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You miserable son of a bitch!&rdquo; &nbsp;Jaren yelled as he bolted to his feet and made his way to Bob with obvious violent intent. &nbsp;It was a side of him which Kathryn had never seen before. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Mr. Snow, <em>STAND DOWN</em>.&rdquo; she bellowed, but not before he&rsquo;d punched the alien as hard as he could in the most head like part of his body. &nbsp;He got two shots in before the mirror ball came apart and constructed several tentacles to pull him away and restrain him. &nbsp;Another tentacle shot out and covered his mouth, muffling his violent outburst.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn and Margaret rushed over. &nbsp;Kathryn took a moment as she was rushing towards Jaren to give Margaret a look and a gesture towards Bob which she understood, and dutifully went to check on him and try to calm him down. &nbsp;Jaren was struggling with any energy he could bring to bear to free himself from the restraints, still screaming into the silver material covering his mouth. &nbsp;She got in front of him, looked him in the eyes and cradled his head on either side with her hands.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Jaren I know, <em>I know</em>. &nbsp;But this isn&rsquo;t helping. &nbsp;Bob didn&rsquo;t do this. &nbsp;His faction has suffered devastating losses themselves at the hands of this enemy. &nbsp;They would have found us eventually anyways, realized the threat we posed and acted before we knew what hit us even if we&rsquo;d never met him&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Her husband was breathing furiously through his nose, leaving trickles of mucus streaming out, but the blind rage in his eyes was giving way slowly to more constrained, more rational anger, and he gradually gave up trying to struggle against the restraints, but still breathing hard with the strain of his efforts.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I can get him to release you, but you have to stop this, do you understand?&rdquo; &nbsp;His eyes darted back and forth between her and Bob with a renewed flash of anger. &nbsp;A part of her, the personal part she had to lock down when being the Captain was scared for him. &nbsp;She had no idea that this kind of behaviour was in him, had never suspected. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been so implacably collected and mild mannered from the first day he crossed into their space and introduced himself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There are bigger things going on here. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s happened, we don&rsquo;t know how bad it is, but we can assume there are people out there who need our help, Koboli who are counting on us. &nbsp;We need to find out if the other colonies were attacked. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re flying blind here and I need my first officer back. &nbsp;I need you to stow the personal shit, just for now,&rdquo; she emphasized, &ldquo;and put your game face back on so we can deal with this situation. &nbsp;Can you do that for me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Jaren closed his eyes. &nbsp;She watched as he focused on slowing his breathing, on relaxing his body. &nbsp;When his breathing returned to something like normal, he opened his eyes again. &nbsp;She saw something she&rsquo;d never seen in them before, cold, calculated hatred. &nbsp;A violent disposition, but for now a constrained one. &nbsp;For a moment she found herself attracted to it, the younger, dumber girl in her excited at the danger or a passionately unpredictable male, but the moment was short, and quickly gave way to a profound concern for him. &nbsp;He seemed to be coming undone in a way she was afraid he might not ever be able to fully put himself back together.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You got this?&rdquo; she asked, and in response his glared at her with cold eyes but slowly nodded his head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn turned her head to the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bob, please release him.&rdquo; &nbsp;The alien emitted high pitched squeals mixed with tones so low she could only feel, sounds she could only assume were some sort of indignant cursing, spared as they were from the mirror ball&rsquo;s translation while it was otherwise occupied.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She held Jaren&rsquo;s hand as she turned fully around to face the alien. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bob. &nbsp;Please. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s calmed down now. &nbsp;We can settle scores later if we need to but right now I need my first officer back at his station.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;More indecipherable sounds emanated from the alien, but were this time accompanied by the mirror ball slowly unwrapping itself from around Jaren&rsquo;s body. &nbsp;He looked down and away as the last silver tentacle pulled itself away from his mouth. &nbsp;As it retreated from him, he looked at neither Bob nor Kathryn as he turned to rigidly return to his station without saying a word.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bob, please set a course for Kobol at best possible speed. &nbsp;Margaret, please work Jaren to piece together what we can from the sensor readings as they come in.&rdquo; &nbsp;The simulant nodded and headed over to Jaren&rsquo;s station. &nbsp;On the way Kathryn grabbed her arm and pulled her close. &nbsp;&ldquo;And please keep an eye on him,&rdquo; she discreetly suggested, and was satisfied enough that she understood both ways she meant it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Engaging engines,&rdquo; Bob stated in response to her orders.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hold on that,&rdquo; she requested. &nbsp;The others on the bridge turned to her inquiringly, and Kathryn let out a slow sigh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bob can this ship be further divided into smaller vessels?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Safely? &nbsp;Three.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn slowly rapped her fingers on the captain seat&rsquo;s armrest. &nbsp;&ldquo;We need to know if they&rsquo;ve hit the other colonies. &nbsp;If they have we&rsquo;ll need to triage, and if they haven&rsquo;t we need to warn them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving this system until we learn more.&rdquo; Jaren snapped. &nbsp;Kathryn raised her hand to him to indicate she knew and understood.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What would make further subdividing the ship more dangerous?&rdquo; she asked Bob.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The shadow material would be stretched dangerously thin if we divide further. &nbsp;More cosmic radiation would penetrate the hull. &nbsp;No material could be shifted to other configurations or to divide the interior without compromising the hull. &nbsp;No resistance to weapons fire or even stray debris in our flight path.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How many could we split into in a pinch?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Four would be dangerous but feasible. &nbsp;Five if you were suicidal. &nbsp;But we&rsquo;re talking little more than a bubble of atmosphere and maneuvering thrusters.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned to Jaren. &nbsp;&ldquo;Anything at all?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Nothing. &nbsp;No comm traffic, no ships on sensors.&rdquo; &nbsp;He sounded dissociated.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn chewed her thumb.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;MUST INSERT AND EMPHASIZE HER CONCERN FOR HER DAUGHTER!!!</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;Jaren, please create a broadcast message that clarifies that despite appearances we are friendlies and find a way to make it believable if you can.&rdquo; &nbsp;He nodded and seemed to get to work. &nbsp;Margaret looked up from his console and nodded at Kathryn, a signal she returned back.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s three Bobbins onboard including yourself?&rdquo; she asked Bob. &nbsp;His amorphous body did its best to nod in response.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay people here&rsquo;s the deal. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re flying blind. &nbsp;We need intel. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to split into four ships, four teams. &nbsp;Jaren, you&rsquo;re going to stay here with Margaret. &nbsp;Bring Ralph with you too. &nbsp;Do what you can on sensors and comms to learn what you can. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m hoping there are some ships hiding out there who will get your message and respond. &nbsp;The rest of us will split up into three other ships. &nbsp;It takes time to charge the solar collectors for an outbound rift, so we&rsquo;ll have to be smart about this.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The rest of us will head to Earth first. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s still a welcome party on that side we&rsquo;ll muster all the aid we can and return to Kobol first and then head out to Haven and Roma. &nbsp;If not, Patricia and a Bobbin will stay behind to investigate in that system while the rest of us head to the Roma system. &nbsp;Same deal, if we can, we&rsquo;ll send back help A-S-A-P. &nbsp;If not, Bob and another of his will remain to investigate while I head to Haven with the last Bobbin.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;From the Haven system we&rsquo;ll open a rift back here right away to report what we find. &nbsp;Bob and Patricia, stay by the crystals. &nbsp;As soon as the collectors are recharged, open a rift and report what you find. &nbsp;Hopefully you&rsquo;ll meet up with ships you can send back for relief efforts.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob lifted one of this three taloned arms. &nbsp;&ldquo;May I make a suggestion Admiral Barnes?&rdquo; &nbsp;She nodded her assent. &nbsp;From Haven instead of immediately calling back here, you should open a portal to our central command. &nbsp;I have no doubt they would want to send relief ships to assist.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Jaren sneered. &nbsp;&ldquo;And scour the ruins of our civilization for any remaining anti-matter while they&rsquo;re at I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Bob turned an unblinking black eye at him for a moment before turning back to Kathryn with what passed for an expectant expression.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;After chewing on her finger for a few minutes, she nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, Bob. &nbsp;Seems we can use all the help we can get.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned to what was left of her crew. &nbsp;&ldquo;It takes forty-five minutes to charge the solar collectors people. &nbsp;Make them count. &nbsp;If&hellip;&rdquo; it was hard to even say the words, but she swallowed hard and continued. &nbsp;Her loyalty was to her home world first, but in a worst-case scenario the strategic imperative would instead be to scour the Koboli system for any anti-matter the Bobbin Collective might have missed. &nbsp;&ldquo;If we all find the same thing, we&rsquo;ll rendez-vous back here, recombine into this more capable ship and make for Kobol to investigate and launch rescue operations. &nbsp;Is everyone clear?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes Captain,&rdquo; they echoed.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Alright people, let&rsquo;s get it done.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;line-height:150%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;'><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">*** &nbsp; *** &nbsp; &nbsp;***</span></p>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The four teams went to four corners of the ship as it existed, and when they were ready, Bob ordered the ship to separate itself into four smaller vessels. &nbsp;Kathryn was made nervous by the way she could see a glow in the material on the side facing the star. &nbsp;It made clear how perilously thin the shell of shadow matter was that guarded her against the had vacuum and torrent of radiation on the other side. &nbsp;She found herself newly appreciative and impressed by the way the shadow matter, operating on the molecular level, could form complex components and machinery, giving each new vessel its own communications system, navigation, propulsion, life support&hellip; &nbsp;She wondered how many centuries it would have taken her own people to develop such technologies on their own. &nbsp;Her pride in her people and how far they&rsquo;d come in such a short time already forbid any sense that they were incapable of doing just about anything given enough time.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Put me through to Jaren please,&rdquo; she asked of the Bobbin who was accompanying her.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Snow here,&rdquo; he coldly answered. &nbsp;He must have known that it was her calling, and she began to wonder if he privately felt as done with her as she did with him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back as soon as we can, I promise. &nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t take much more than half an hour to quickly hop form Earth, to Roma, to Haven, and back without having to wait for the collectors to recharge.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; &nbsp;His response was cold, barely looking back through the screen, his gaze falling slightly off to the side to avoid looking her in the eyes. &nbsp;Something seemed to shift in him though, as though he just then for a moment remembered that she was his wife, the mother of his daughter, and that he loved her. &nbsp;He looked more directly at her through the screen and softened for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good Luck Kat,&rdquo; he offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He literally bit his lip. &nbsp;&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s only Kobol.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn got the sense that the sentiment didn&rsquo;t feel true to him, but that he knew it was how he ought to feel and wanted to manifest it into reality or at least assure her and anyone else listening in that he wasn&rsquo;t completely lost or insensitive to the fears of others, regardless of what he was going through in the moment. &nbsp;She took the moment to remember that he was a good man, that she&rsquo;d had reason to fall in love with him and create Maggie with him.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not as bad as we fear on Kobol. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can so we can find out together. &nbsp;Barnes out.&rdquo; &nbsp;She nodded at Bob and he cut the channel. &nbsp;She was impressed with how quickly Bob and his compatriots were able to adapt to how the humans operated and interpret completely alien gestures and sentiments.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Okay Bob, let&rsquo;s get underway. &nbsp;Open a rift to the Sol System please.&rdquo; &nbsp;It nodded and turned to its console and after a few talon jabs at the controls, she saw on the forward section which had configured itself into the view screen the now familiar sight of massive pillars of raw energy streaming down onto the purple crystal and explode it to vapour. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She looked down and pressed the button labeled ship to ship. &nbsp;&ldquo;Beta here. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll take point. &nbsp;Gamma and Delta follow close behind. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not much we can do if there&rsquo;s a Collective armada on the other side, so think good thoughts. &nbsp;And on that note, everyone start broadcasting friendly IDC now before we go through in case there&rsquo;s a human armada waiting to blow us out of the sky.&rdquo; &nbsp;After hearing acknowledgements from the other ships, she gave the order to head out.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;As soon as they emerged from the rift cloud, her view screen lit up with a flash and she felt the frail little craft rocked with shudders from explosions on the surface. &nbsp;Demanding a report from Bob, the bombardment had ceased before he could finish answering.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is a small fleet of human vessels immediately before us. &nbsp;They fired on us immediately upon entering the system, but seem to have now stopped. &nbsp;Presumably they have accepted your identification codes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She didn&rsquo;t wait to ask why their weapons hadn&rsquo;t penetrated the thin hull, instead pressing the ship to ship button again, tuned to human communications frequencies. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hold your fire! &nbsp;This is Admiral Kathryn Barnes onboard an alien but friendly ship, please respond. &nbsp;Be advised there are two similar ships following behind, also friendlies. &nbsp;I repeat, hold your fire, we are friendlies. &nbsp;Please respond.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;An unknown but stern voice with a strong no fucking around tone answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alien vessel. &nbsp;Come to a relative stop immediately and hold your position. &nbsp;If you make any other move while we attempt to verify your IDC you will be destroyed immediately.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood, thank you. &nbsp;Standing by.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Unlikely,&rdquo; Bob surmised though his mirror ball as she closed the channel and turned to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;They are only carrying conventional human weapons. &nbsp;Even compromised as our hull may be stretched so thin, it can still withstand such a barrage. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not detecting any nuclear or anti-matter warheads on their vessels. &nbsp;We should be safe even if they determine us a threat.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure,&rdquo; Kathryn responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised how inventive humans can be with doing damage when we&rsquo;re backed into a corner,&rdquo; she added with bittersweet pride. &nbsp;&ldquo;Have the other ships come through?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Affirmative.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Can you make out any identifying markings on that ship?&rdquo; &nbsp;She watched as the viewscreen narrowed in on the hull of the lead human ship and scanned. &nbsp;She recognized it as dreadnought class, but as the fleet workhorse there were quite a few of them out there. &nbsp;The viewscreen stopped on the serial number and name painted on the hull. &nbsp;&ldquo;S.F.S. Sengupta&hellip;&rdquo; she rubbed fingers on her forehead trying to remember who commanded the ship. &nbsp;She snapped her fingers when she remembered and reopened ship to ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Is that Captain Ryan over there I&rsquo;m speaking to? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever actually met but I&rsquo;m a fan of his work.&rdquo; &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t actually have any flipping clue about his service record but she at this point&hellip; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have a lot of questions, I can&rsquo;t wait to answer them. &nbsp;Have a fair number of my burning questions myself over here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;A video call pinged on her console and she put it on the main screen. &nbsp;A man in his forties with a face of weathered skin framed by a sparse salt and pepper beard and military cropped hair appeared on the screen. &nbsp;She imagined his general sneer to be a permanent feature of his face; she&rsquo;d known a number of old sea dogs in the fleet who preferred to spend their lives in space and recognized the kind of man she was dealing with immediately.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;IDC acknowledged Admiral. &nbsp;You were declared M.I.A. over a week ago. &nbsp;The vessel you are travelling in matches characteristics of a fleet of vessels reported to have obliterated Kobol twenty-seven hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn&rsquo;s face and heart sank at the news. &nbsp;&ldquo;Survivors?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Reports are from a small number of survivors who rifted here soon after. &nbsp;The aliens came here as well, but left soon after. &nbsp;Not before destroying the patrol ships stationed at the crystal who intercepted them. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had reports of similar encounters in the Haven and Roma systems as well.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn took what small comfort she could in hearing of the more limited encounters in the other systems compared to Kobol.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Now if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind explaining your role in all this, why you&rsquo;ve arrived in an enemy ship, and what the hell is going on here, this transmission is being relayed to Command back on Orbital One.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a long story.&rdquo; &nbsp;Captain Ryan frowned with a menacing edge. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain the need to know now and can fill in the rest of the details later. &nbsp;But first, is there a relief effort being organized for Kobol?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Relief?&rdquo; &nbsp;The captain repeated, seeming confused. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, no relief efforts. &nbsp;The only survivors were some small craft in transit between the planet and the rift at the time of the attack. &nbsp;One of them swung back to survey the damage before coming here, they reported every trace of human habitation on the planet gone, destroyed. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no one to save, nothing left to salvage.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Kathryn dropped her head, holding her face up with her palms. &nbsp;Her heart broke for Jaren, and then for every other survivor, and then for the dead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; She affirmed grimly as she looked back up at the screen.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Bottom line is the aliens we have both encountered are the same species, but of two different factions. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve stumbled ass first and unprepared into a galactic civil war. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re travelling with some of them now, in ships of their design and technology.&rdquo; &nbsp;She gestured over her shoulder to Bob. &nbsp;&ldquo;I would call this one my friend,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We came to propose an alliance to avoid what happened to Kobol before it happened but we were too late. &nbsp;&ldquo;If Bob&rsquo;s side-&rdquo; she paused and winced at hearing herself refer to him that way and to Captain Ryan&rsquo;s all too appropriate raised eyebrow but continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;If his side looses, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the enemy faction overrun the galaxy and exterminate us. &nbsp;They only left the other systems alone because they didn&rsquo;t detect anti-matter, the one thing that threatens them, something they detected an abundance of on Kobol. &nbsp;But they know can make it. &nbsp;They have more pressing war imperatives at the moment, but once they&rsquo;ve won they&rsquo;ll turn back to us as an unacceptable threat and we&rsquo;ll all face the same fate as Kobol.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Ryan was looking slightly down and away, slowly nodding as he absorbed what she was telling him. &nbsp;After processing for a few moments more, he simply asked: &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The moment the collectors are charged I need our three shifts to be allowed to transit back to the Koboli system to retrieve our fourth and bring them back here. &nbsp;In the meantime, I need you to put me and my friend here in a room with the senior staff and the highest available representatives of our remaining governments so we can explain and negotiate.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Ryan acknowledged.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;This ship will reconfigure into one ship wait to rift back. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d appreciate if you could spare a ship to escort them. &nbsp;In the meantime Bob and I will transfer to one of your ships and make for Earth.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ryan further nodded his acknowledgement.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;One more thing Captain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;New Horizon II. &nbsp;Where is she? &nbsp;My daughter was onboard as well as a number of close friends. &nbsp;Are they safe?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;To my knowledge New Horizon recently docked at Orbital One with everyone you sent back safe and accounted for.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Oh thank God&hellip;&rdquo; she didn&rsquo;t mean to say out loud.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Small miracles,&rdquo; Ryan offered with mild sardonia.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I assure you Mr. Ryan. &nbsp;This fight is far from over. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have your chance for payback, you have my word.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The man brightened with a smirk and Kathryn closed the channel.</p>
