            <p class="lead"><em>In the year 2854 of the old calendar</em></p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren burst through Kathryn's office door. He was obviously very excited but as frantically as he
                had come through the doorway, he now played nonchalant to a comic extent. As she watched he began
                casually moving about her office, inspecting her many awards and citations, the model of New Horizon she
                had on the desk, casually extending his fingers to inspect his nails</p>
            <p class="lead">What? Kathryn asked, feigning irritation.</p>
            <p class="lead">Oh no, no, no, oh nothing really.</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn looked at him, waiting for him to stop being an ass. I know you think you're funny?
                But you're not.</p>
            <p class="lead">He smiled that mischievous smile at her which she had found so intriguing all those years ago, and which
                had kept her wanting to know more from the day he landed on her planet.</p>
            <p class="lead">No big deal really, I'm sure you have more important things to deal with than
                contact from Epsilon.</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn's mouth fell open, then she scrambled up from behind her desk and rushed past him through
                the door. Jaren smiled, pushed himself off of the wall and followed her out.</p>
            <p class="lead">When Kobol first developed the Escher Rift system which allowed them to open rifts with the power of a
                star between systems, the first thing they did was to send automated probes to the stars around which
                the other Terran colony ships had lumbered to at only a little better than a tenth of the speed of
                light. These probe ships contained within themselves everything they needed to establish a rift system
                from scratch around another star, including a ridiculous amount of anti-matter fuel to slow them from
                the ridiculous speeds they were sped up to with ridiculously powered lasers on their light sails on the
                way out of the system.</p>
            <p class="lead">After sending these rift ships to Roma, Haven, and the Earth itself, they kept building, and kept sending
                them to stars no human had ever been to before. Earth was Alpha, Kobol Beta, Roma Gamma, and Haven
                Delta. Epsilon was their code word for whichever rift ship made contact with them first after
                establishing a new rift system.</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn rushed into the control room on Orbital One, bowling over some poor tech as she did. She hastily
                apologized and helped him gather up her things and then entered 'the pit', thirty work
                stations in the bottom of the large room, all facing the gigantic monitor wall at the front of the
                semicircular shaped room.</p>
            <p class="lead">She got behind one of the techs at their station and rested her hand on his shoulder as she looked over
                it to the screen he was looking at. What system? she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">Sixty-one Cygni.</p>
            <p class="lead">Tell me about it.</p>
            <p class="lead">It's a binary K type system.</p>
            <p class="lead">Binary, really throw the data up on the wall.</p>
            <p class="lead">The tech obeyed and the technical readouts of the rift ships' first report of the configuration and
                conditions of the system. Kathryn stepped back to look, bumped into Jaren who had come to stand behind
                her, and he put his arm around her. They silently surveyed the data together, which was being streamed
                through the first rift opened between Sol and 61 Cygni.</p>
            <p class="lead">The rift ship reported that as per it's programming it had identified the nearest Earth analogue
                and established the rift system around the nearest star to it.</p>
            <p class="lead">Look at that planet Kathryn marvelled as she surveyed the readout.
                It's mass, size, magnetic field, all like Earth.</p>
            <p class="lead">Yes, but look at the atmosphere readings, mainly nitrogen is good, but look, carbon dioxide,
                monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide a pretty toxic stew.</p>
            <p class="lead">I know what that is, Kathryn said, looking up at him. That's Earth without
                life.</p>
            <p class="lead">How do you mean?</p>
            <p class="lead">That's what Earth would still be like if life had never happened, isn't it?</p>
            <p class="lead">You're absolutely right! Which in theory makes it perfect for terraforming. I mean,
                eventually of course. It would be a long, long process. But look at those other planets, wow an
                ice giant further out from that proto Earth, binary dwarf planets behond that oh and the other
                star, a big gas giant at four AU, and binary frozen terrestrials beyond.</p>
            <p class="lead">Oh wow, look at that! Two ringed giants orbiting each other, together orbiting the center of
                gravity of the two stars. I never thought I'd see so much binarism? Is that the
                word? Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">I guess it is now, Jaren mused.</p>
            <p class="lead">Ohhh we've so got to go check this system out.</p>
            <p class="lead">Itching to get back out in the field hunh?</p>
            <p class="lead">Ugh, yes. Commanding this station has been good for the family, us getting to work together,
                having a stable environment for Maggie, but it's been fifteen years since we settled down Jaren.
                I'm a born explorer and having this glorified desk job has been killing me just a little bit every
                day. She put her fingers very nearly together to indicate just how much. Okay maybe not
                that dramatic, but you know what I mean?</p>
            <p class="lead">I do. I've quite enjoyed the peace of this job but I agree, I think it's high time to
                get back out there. With our records and background I'm sure we can pull strings and get assigned
                to this project. We could get the old Earth team back together, it'd be fun!</p>
            <p class="lead">Too bad we can't get the old New Horizon out of mothballs and take it. New Horizon
                was the original generational starship Kathryn's people had taken to Haven some six centuries ago.
                It was retrofitted to go on a mission back to Earth fifteen years ago when Jaren's people made
                first contact with Kathryn's after six hundred years of silence across the void. Kathryn's
                people had lost the technological ability to send such a message while Jaren's had taken that long
                to discover the will to.</p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren laughed. We probably could if we really wanted to, but I'll be much happier to take
                the new one. Where is New Horizon II?</p>
            <p class="lead">It is Kathryn trailed off as she sought the answer at one of the empty work
                stations in front of them, currently on assignment studying the outer binary gas giants in the
                Haven system.</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn leaned back against the railing behind her and put her hands out to her side, grasping the cool
                smooth round metal. A whole new system to explore she said distantly. And I
                was just getting my head around the systems we are already familiar with.</p>
            <p class="lead">I know, I know</p>
            <p class="lead">Well, New Horizon II is a joint project, we'll have to convince all the governments to
                reassign it, but I don't think that'll be a problem. The harder part will be convincing them
                to let us go when there are so many on the way up chomping at the bit to get out there
                themselves.</p>
            <p class="lead">Oh please, Jaren retorted, the Star Fleet has gotten out there plenty and all the
                younger officers have had their chance at a tour on New Horizon II. Hell we'll be taking the best
                and brightest with us, there's plenty of opportunity. What I've been thinking is that
                Epsilon is just the first of many.</p>
            <p class="lead">Star Fleet was the new umbrella organization under which all joint exploration projects had been
                developed. The Kobolians had a robust navy of their own, the Romans a far more modest one, and the
                Havenites having only developed the capacity for achieving orbit themselves fifteen years ago, but all
                joint projects operated under the Star Fleet. New Horizon II was the first ship built specifically for
                exploration and research under the joint banner. Star Fleet command also operated all Terran facilities
                such as the massive Orbital One station they were currently standing in. It was a relic from the time
                before the plague on Earth which they lovingly refurbished after finally making their way back to Earth
                fifteen years ago. The handful of research facilities down on the surface as well as the few refurbished
                off world bases elsewhere in the system were also operated under Star Fleet.</p>
            <p class="lead">We've sent dozens of seed ships out there by now and this is just the first one to signal
                back successfully, Jaren thoughtfully observed. Pretty soon we're going to need a
                whole fleet of ships like New Horizon II to explore them all.</p>
            <p class="lead">Definitely exciting times to be alive, Kathryn mused. Well, she said as she
                pushed herself off of the railing. I'll start drafting the press release, how bout you
                start notifying the governments, then we'll start figuring out how we're going to worm our
                way into the mission.</p>
            <p class="lead">Yes Admiral, right away. Jaren offered with a wink.</p>
