            <p class="lead"><em>In the year 2854 of the old calendar&hellip;</em></p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren burst through Kathryn's office door. He was obviously very excited but as frantically
                as he had come through the doorway, he now played nonchalant to a comic extent. As she watched he began
                casually moving about her office, inspecting her many awards and citations, the model of New Horizon she
                had on the desk, casually extending his fingers to inspect his nails&hellip;</p>
            <p class="lead">"What?" Kathryn asked, feigning irritation.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Oh no, no, no, oh&hellip; nothing really."</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn looked at him, waiting for him to stop being an ass. "I know you think you're funny?
                But you're not."</p>
            <p class="lead">He smiled that mischievous smile at her which she had found so intriguing all those years
                ago, and which had kept her wanting to know more from the day he landed on her planet.</p>
            <p class="lead">"No big deal really, I'm sure you have more important things to deal with than&hellip;
                contact from Epsilon."</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn's mouth fell open, then she scrambled up from behind her desk and rushed past him
                through the door. Jaren smiled, pushed himself off of the wall and followed her out.</p>
            <p class="lead"></p>
            <p class="lead">When Kobol first developed the Escher Rift system which allowed them to open rifts with the
                power of a star between systems, the first thing they did was to send automated probes to the stars
                around which the other Terran colony ships had lumbered to at only a little better than a tenth of the
                speed of light. These probe ships contained within themselves everything they needed to establish a rift
                system from scratch around another star, including a ridiculous amount of anti-matter fuel to slow them
                from the ridiculous speeds they were sped up to with ridiculously powered lasers on their light sails on
                the way out of the system.</p>
            <p class="lead">After sending these rift ships to Roma, Haven, and the Earth itself, they kept building, and
                kept sending them to stars no human had ever been to before. Earth was Alpha, Kobol Beta, Roma Gamma,
                and Haven Delta. Epsilon was their code word for whichever rift ship made contact with them first after
                establishing a new rift system.</p>
            <p class="lead"></p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn rushed into the control room on Orbital One, bowling over some poor tech as she did.
                She hastily apologized and helped him gather up her things and then entered &lsquo;the pit', thirty work
                stations in the bottom of the large room, all facing the gigantic monitor wall at the front of the
                semicircular shaped room.</p>
            <p class="lead">She got behind one of the techs at their station and rested her hand on his shoulder as she
                looked over it to the screen he was looking at. "What system?" she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Sixty-one Cygni."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Tell me about it."</p>
            <p class="lead">"It's a binary K type system."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Binary, really&hellip; throw the data up on the wall."</p>
            <p class="lead">The tech obeyed and the technical readouts of the rift ships' first report of the
                configuration and conditions of the system. Kathryn stepped back to look, bumped into Jaren who had come
                to stand behind her, and he put his arm around her. They silently surveyed the data together, which was
                being streamed through the first rift opened between Sol and 61 Cygni.</p>
            <p class="lead">The rift ship reported that as per it's programming it had identified the nearest Earth
                analogue and established the rift system around the nearest star to it.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Look at that planet&hellip;" Kathryn marvelled as she surveyed the readout. "It's mass,
                size, magnetic field, all like Earth."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Yes, but look at the atmosphere readings, mainly nitrogen is good, but look, carbon
                dioxide, monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide&hellip; a pretty toxic stew."</p>
            <p class="lead">"I know what that is," Kathryn said, looking up at him. "That's Earth without life."</p>
            <p class="lead">"How do you mean?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"That's what Earth would still be like if life had never happened, isn't it?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"You're absolutely right! Which in theory makes it perfect for terraforming. I mean,
                eventually of course. It would be a long, long process. But look at those other planets, wow&hellip; an
                ice giant further out from that proto Earth, binary dwarf planets behond that&hellip; oh and the other
                star, a big gas giant at four AU, and binary frozen terrestrials beyond."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Oh wow, look at that! Two ringed giants orbiting each other, together orbiting the center
                of gravity of the two stars. I never thought I'd see so much&hellip; binarism? Is that the word?"
                Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">"I guess it is now," Jaren mused.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Ohhh we've so got to go check this system out."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Itching to get back out in the field hunh?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Ugh, yes. Commanding this station has been good for the family, us getting to work
                together, having a stable environment for Maggie, but it's been fifteen years since we settled down
                Jaren. I'm a born explorer and having this glorified desk job has been killing me just a little bit
                every day." She put her fingers very nearly together to indicate just how much. "Okay maybe not that
                dramatic, but you know what I mean?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"I do. I've quite enjoyed the peace of this job but I agree, I think it's high time to get
                back out there. With our records and background I'm sure we can pull strings and get assigned to this
                project. We could get the old Earth team back together, it'd be fun!"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Too bad we can't get the old New Horizon out of mothballs and take it." New Horizon was the
                original generational starship Kathryn's people had taken to Haven some six centuries ago. It was
                retrofitted to go on a mission back to Earth fifteen years ago when Jaren's people made first contact
                with Kathryn's after six hundred years of silence across the void. Kathryn's people had lost the
                technological ability to send such a message while Jaren's had taken that long to discover the will to.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren laughed. "We probably could if we really wanted to, but I'll be much happier to take
                the new one. Where is New Horizon II?</p>
            <p class="lead">"It is&hellip;" Kathryn trailed off as she sought the answer at one of the empty work
                stations in front of them, "currently on assignment studying the outer binary gas giants in the Haven
                system."</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn leaned back against the railing behind her and put her hands out to her side,
                grasping the cool smooth round metal. "A whole new system to explore&hellip;" she said distantly. "And I
                was just getting my head around the systems we are already familiar with."</p>
            <p class="lead">"I know, I know&hellip;"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Well, New Horizon II is a joint project, we'll have to convince all the governments to
                reassign it, but I don't think that'll be a problem. The harder part will be convincing them to let us
                go when there are so many on the way up chomping at the bit to get out there themselves."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Oh please," Jaren retorted, "the Star Fleet has gotten out there plenty and all the younger
                officers have had their chance at a tour on New Horizon II. Hell we'll be taking the best and brightest
                with us, there's plenty of opportunity. What I've been thinking is that Epsilon is just the first of
                many."</p>
            <p class="lead">Star Fleet was the new umbrella organization under which all joint exploration projects had
                been developed. The Kobolians had a robust navy of their own, the Romans a far more modest one, and the
                Havenites having only developed the capacity for achieving orbit themselves fifteen years ago, but all
                joint projects operated under the Star Fleet. New Horizon II was the first ship built specifically for
                exploration and research under the joint banner. Star Fleet command also operated all Terran facilities
                such as the massive Orbital One station they were currently standing in. It was a relic from the time
                before the plague on Earth which they lovingly refurbished after finally making their way back to Earth
                fifteen years ago. The handful of research facilities down on the surface as well as the few refurbished
                off world bases elsewhere in the system were also operated under Star Fleet.</p>
            <p class="lead">"We've sent dozens of seed ships out there by now and this is just the first one to signal
                back successfully," Jaren thoughtfully observed. "Pretty soon we're going to need a whole fleet of ships
                like New Horizon II to explore them all."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Definitely exciting times to be alive," Kathryn mused. "Well," she said as she pushed
                herself off of the railing. "I'll start drafting the press release, how bout you start notifying the
                governments, then we'll start figuring out how we're going to worm our way into the mission."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Yes Admiral, right away." Jaren offered with a wink.</p>
