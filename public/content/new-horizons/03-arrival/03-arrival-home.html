            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything actually trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.

            Arrival, the second book, is about what happens when they ultimately arrive. Simulants of the
            original mission founders wake up expecting to help establish a toehold on the new planet, but find
            themselves instead mediating bitter conflicts amongst the crew. One faction takes drastic action and the
            results leave not only the mission's ultimate success in peril, but the lives of everyone who travelled so
            far...

                After a twenty year burn, the Generational Starship 'New Horizon' cut its ion engines and
                silently slid into shallower waters of the cosmic ocean. After a century and a half of anticipation,
                they finally left the deep ocean of the interstellar void, and arrived on the shores of an alien star
                system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                It had been ten years since the crew first detected indications that they were entering a
                new star system. It was at this point that they'd entered the stellar bow shock zone, where light
                pressure and high energy radiation from the Sigma Draconis star began to be the dominant force, as
                opposed to the more general galactic cosmic rays which dominated the radiation environment of
                interstellar space. It was the same standard by which over two hundred years ago the Voyager space
                probes had been deemed to have officially reached interstellar space, officially marking the beginning
                of humans beings as an interstellar civilization in the process. There was a direct line between the
                spirit with which Voyager I and II were launched, and the spirit of the G.S.S. New Horizon.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                For the first few years they made their way through their new system's equivalent of the
                Oort Cloud, a spherical halo of comets of all shapes and sizes. While the total mass of the icy cloud
                was about three times that of the ship's target planet, the gargantuan volume which they occupied meant
                that they hardly ever came into contact with each other. When they did, one would sometimes begin slowly
                tumbling down into the gravity well of the star, and more often than not they would get swallowed up by
                the binary outer gas giants. Except for the exceptionally lucky ones, most comets which fell in from the
                Oort cloud would, over hundreds and hundreds of orbits (if they were even that lucky), inevitably chance
                an encounter with this two planet system and find their final resting place.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Once past this system's Kuiper Belt region of the outer star system, the ship passed two
                massive gas giants eternally dancing around each other in the distant cold of the system. One was a more
                massive Jupiter type of planet, and the other was a super Neptune, an icy giant with a mass somewhere
                between that of Saturn and Jupiter. A plethora of rocky moons of all shapes, sizes, and compositions
                found their celestial homes in orbit around one of these titans of the system. The New Horizon's crew
                could only take a quick look with their eyes and telescopes as they sailed past the system and
                manoeuvred themselves ahead of the more massive planet.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Sailing ahead of the larger ball of gas allowed the New Horizon to slow itself down by being
                pulled back towards it, a manoeuver known as gravity braking. Other kinds of ships back in their home
                star system had been engineered to be able to brake atmospherically through friction while flying
                through a gas giant's atmosphere, but a ship like the New Horizon was never designed to fly through any
                kind of planetary atmosphere whatsoever. It was in fact remarkably fragile in this respect. Gravity
                braking ahead of the system's most massive planet allowed them to bleed tremendous amounts of kinetic
                energy and dramatically fell their orbit down into the inner solar system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Far distant from their gas giant rendezvous, the crew watched mesmerized as they had a
                similar fly-by encounter with a super-Earth type planet near the orbit of what would have been the
                asteroid belt in the Sol System. For a couple decades now, the crew had had the chance to study the
                Haven system and they'd discovered that this planet was four times as massive as the Earth and double
                the density which meant that the gravity at the surface was more than two and a half times what a human
                was used to. If this alone didn't make the planet seem inhospitable enough, observations revealed an
                intense magnetic field and rampant volcanism and tectonic activity. All the crew could see with the
                naked eye as they passed the planet for another gravitational braking maneuver was the thick toxic
                yellow and green atmosphere, which would have been reminiscent of Venus to their ancestors who had
                originally left their home star system.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Closer in than the orbit of Haven itself (which was roughly equivalent to Earth's), was a
                hot ice giant, a planet of the same approximate mass and composition as Uranus and Neptune, but in an
                orbit as close to the star as that of Mercury. Future Haven astronomers would later surmise that the
                giant's original location had been somewhere between the orbits of the double gas giant system and the
                super-Earth, but had been flung inward towards the star through unstable three body interactions with
                the outer giants. All any individual human could ever see was a snapshot of the body's excruciatingly
                slow death as its orbit gradually decayed in the solar atmosphere towards its inevitably fiery and
                unceremonious death, when it would be ripped apart and swallowed by its star.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The ship arrived at Haven and successfully manoeuvred into a stable orbit around the planet.
                Six satellites were launched in rapid succession out of the tube they had been carefully installed in so
                long ago. Each began only a few meters across on any given side, but once launched from the ship, they
                beautifully unfurled into a structure easily three times larger than their original size, exposing the
                entire suite of their instruments to the planet, including everything any of the crew on the ship or on
                any planet could ever need. They were a real time communications network and were full spectrum light
                detectors, able to turn those eyes down onto the planet for study, or back out to the depths of space.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The crew cautiously celebrated that the initial studies didn't indicate any reason why this
                planet would be uninhabitable for them. So far it didn't look like they would have to resupply and begin
                yet another multi-generational journey to yet another star, or worse back home. The satellites moved
                into their proper orbits, and immediately began studying Haven in far greater detail than the ship could
                on approach with its own instruments. Their first job was to find the first landing site for the crew
                after studying the planet's climate and geography. The rest would be up to the crew itself...

                "Hello? Do you know who you are? Where you are? ...<em>What</em> you are?" He was asked
                after opening his eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Give me a second..." Wiremu asked as he looked up to the ceiling for a few moments as he
                tried to remember. "Yes. My name is Wiremu Tynes... this is supposed to be the New Horizon."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"It is." his interrogator confirmed. "Do you remember what you are?"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "...What I am?" It struck him as such an absurd question, but then he remembered. "Oh
                right, uh... I'm a simulant."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Yes. Does everything feel right to you? Were all of your memo-ries properly integrated?
                There was an... incident along the way which involved you we were worried you may have been adversely
                affected."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I think I'm all here... I seem to have all of the memories I should expect to have....
                everything that was available up until a few weeks before the launch anyways..." He was now remembering
                that the original Wiremu Tynes, of whom he was a simulation, must be long dead now. He was a
                sophisticated mechanoid, who was running a sophisticated personality simulation program on the quantum
                computer brain in his head. The intended effect, was to create the illusion both to himself and to
                others, that he was in fact the person he was a replication of. "We've made it to the Sigma Draconis
                system then? We really... we really actually made it?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Don't sound so surprised." the human said with an edge which bordered on a snarl. "We're in
                orbit around Haven right now."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Hot damn!!" Wiremu excitedly exclaimed, but then his heart sank (or whatever the equivalent
                feeling should be characterized as, for a being such as himself). "Wait, why didn't you wake us up
                earlier? We wanted to see the approach and everything we were supposed to help you navigate into the
                system!" Wiremu was the ship's original captain, and he was disappointed that he'd missed the most
                interesting space flight aspect of their mission. From his decades with the Peacekeepers and the Trade
                Corps, he'd been so intimately familiar with the Sol System. Part of the whole point of him
                participating in this ultimate Hail Mary pass was to get the chance to navigate through an entirely new
                and alien star system. He'd been so looking forward to it... or more accurately the original him had
                been so looking forward to it. But if he wasn't Wiremu, then why should their arrival matter to him at
                all? It was all confusing him already.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "To be honest, we... just forgot. We were too busy with all of the work required for the
                most critical part of our journey. I suppose it just didn't seem important enough to remember."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                That didn't sit well with Wiremu. He didn't like the idea that the expressed wishes of he
                and the other mission founders could be so easily and remorselessly 'forgotten.' He could only wonder
                what other explicit instructions they'd left which had also been ignored. He scrutinized this other
                person in the room who appeared to be so carelessly masking his disdain. He had black hair which came
                down to the bottom of his ears, a brown Arab complexion, angular nose, and beady black eyes which had
                yet to look away.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"So who are <em>you</em> then?" Wiremu asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">"My name is Asari. I'm the current patriarch..."</p>
