            The New Horizons six part book series about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic 
            thinking through of how it could all work out despite everything in reality trending so negatively. 
            have written in journals since I was a teenager, but this was my first attempt at novel scale writing.
        </p>  
        <p class="lead">
            It starts in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and centres on a generational starship which 
            leaves on a 150 year journey to a distant neighbouring star.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I remember the day I conceived to the original premise, a trilogy of books with the first entry being about
            those who chose to leave, those condemned to live and die on the ship, and the third about those burdened
            with trying to make a go of it when they finally arrived.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            It didn't take long after finishing the third that I started writing the first of a sequel trilogy, 
            which I am currently working on completeing.  Some time after I understood the need for a more refined reader 
            focused entry into the series, and I replaced Launch with Chasing Stars as the official first entry in the 
            series.

            I would point out that I conceived of and wrote of the original trilogy well before I read 
            The Expanse, and any common elements are convergent design.  I was focusing on reading the classics of science
            fiction to develop my writing and at some point begrudgingly conceded the need to read something more modern
            and I reached for The Expanse as some modern trash commercial fiction to read for reference.  It was so good
            it made me want to stop writing because I knew I could never do it that well.  So all due respect, but what I've
            written was original to me at the time.  The differences are vast next to any common elements.
