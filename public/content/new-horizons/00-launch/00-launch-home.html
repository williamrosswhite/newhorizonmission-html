            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything actually trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.

            Launch, the first book, is about a man who grew up with maximum privilege and able to do
            anything with his life, but feels a profound ambivalence which comes from a lack of a driving force in his
            life. Applying to the New Horizons program effectively on a whim, he wins a spot and has to come to
            understand why he finds himself wanting to go, and walk away from his terrestrial obligations to surrender
            all his privilige, and die in deep space for a dream he'll never personally see realized.

                It was a warm Mediterranean evening in Alexandria, Egypt. It was early fall, and seated
                around the modest table were some of the most impressive Human Beings that Earth had to offer these
                days. They were collectively referred to as the famous four, and would become ever more so in the coming
                years. Master Sadhika Sengupta was a technological wizard, a born engineer who in her adolescence had
                become captivated by biochemistry and microbiology. Combi-ning these passions, she had over the decades
                become an industrial giant in the perpetually lucrative biotechnology industries. She had always been,
                and continued to be, the nominal head of Brahma Biotech, the synthetic biology and genetic technology
                company she had founded after completing both her microbiology and biochemistry PhDs at only
                twenty-three years old.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "What...<em> exactly </em>is meant by 'no indications of complex life?'" Ever concerned with
                detail, and the exact meaning of words, Kim In-su was the soul of their little group. The Korean born
                wordsmith was one of the most accomplished and revered linguists and authors in contemporary Earth
                society. He spoke eight languages fluently and had a long resume of poetry, novels, and translations to
                his credit. Words, and their precise meaning in usage, were very important to him.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Well, that is actually pretty hard to say," Neil Sagan admitted. He was the exoplanetary
                scientist of the group. It was his team which had pioneered much of the research that had been done into
                what planets in the local stellar neighborhood might be habitable for humans. The long retired NASA
                Terrestrial Planet Finder had identified many such planets, but studying the light and spectra coming
                from them was challenging work. It was however, a field in which that hard work usually paid off.
                "<em>Technically</em> all it means is that the spectra reveal abundant free oxygen in the atmosphere.
                The only way we know this to be possible is if the oxygen is continually being produced. We think that
                would indicate prolific plant life, with sufficient animal life to consume that oxygen and create carbon
                di-oxide for the plants to consume in turn. It's the cycle that exists here on Earth."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Why does it have to be continually produced to be there?" In-su asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Well, cuz free oxygen is fairly unstable. Once in the atmosphere it's really easy for it to
                find something to react with. As a result, oxygen levels shouldn't be able to get to any substantial
                amount unless it's continuously being put into the atmosphere quicker than it's being burned up in
                reactions. The only natural mechanism we know of that does this is the photosynthesis of plants." In-su
                nodded his understanding.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "No indications of complex life <em>also</em> means," Neil continued, "that there's no
                indications of industrialization like chlorofluorohydro-carbons in the atmosphere; we don't know of any
                natural process that can put them up there.<strong> </strong>Of course... there's a <em>humongous</em>
                gulf between the emergence of animal life, and the development of industrialization as we know it. I
                mean... people looking at Earth today the same way we're looking out into the universe, would only have
                found these indications as recently as six hundred years ago. Modern humans have been around much longer
                than that though."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Hmmm...," In-su considered. "That is <em>quite</em> a gulf. I'd hate to see a repeat of
                what happened to the Americans here... especially to be the cause of it personally."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I wouldn't worry about that," Sadhika suggested. "We are aware of those risks and we will
                have strict protocols. We'll um, well... I mean <em>they,</em> will orbit the planet and send
                hermetically sealed research teams and simulants down for some time before they actually land themselves
                and spill out onto the planet. Unlike the Europeans, <em>we</em> will be <em>aware</em> of the risk, and
                we'll actually take care. Again, I mean <em>they</em>. Sorry."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Spilling out onto the planet, what a powerful image..." In-su mused.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Look, I know this is kind of esoteric," Wiremu offered while shifting in his seat, "but
                what exactly <em>is</em> the cutoff point for us between intelligent and non-intelligent life? I mean...
                of course we don't expect to find like, chimps and bonobos out there, but what tips us off to say 'hey,
                that's <em>intelligent</em> life?" The hard science of the mission was usually over Captain Wiremu
                Tynes' head, but he knew enough, and was smart enough, to ask the right questions. This had taken him
                far in life; he'd seen a lot, and been faced with an array of novel ethical quandaries in his
                thirty-five years in the Trade Corps sailing all over the Solar System.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Any such distinction would ultimately be arbitrary," Neil answered abruptly. "All we can
                say at the moment, at this point, is that any signs of industrialization at all in the spectra of an
                atmosphere would rule out a candidate planet for colonization. If... such signs were detected." He then
                added, "Of course we've never seen such signs anywhere but here..."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Wiremu harrumphed. "That's not a very satisfying answer..."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                In-su smiled at him. "The most interesting questions never have one Wii... So," he
                continued, turning back to Neil, "how far <em>is</em> Sigma Draconis?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Um... eighteen-point-eight light years," Neil replied after consulting with his scroll.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Wiremu whistled slowly over the size of the distance. "That sure ain't a vacation hop is it?
                Let's see..." he reached across the table to the napkin dispenser and withdrew one, then started
                scribbling some calculations on it with a pen. "With the thrust engineers claim the next generation ion
                engines'll be able to generate... if we used four of them on a ship the size we're talking about... we
                should be able to achieve an effective acceleration of around six point two centimeters per second
                squared."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"That doesn't sound like much," In-su remarked.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "No, but over twenty continuous years of it," Wiremu explained, "it's enough to get us all
                the way up to thirteen percent of the speed of light." He flipped the napkin over and did some further
                calculations on the other side. "Given that... from orbit to orbit I figure it'll take about a hundred
                and sixty years, give or take."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Really! That long?" In-su asked, surprised.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Well, it's really <em>really</em> far away!" Neil retorted with a chuckle. "Besides, you
                already knew that none of us would actually get to arrive there ourselves, that's just... well that's
                just part of the deal," he pointed out.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Yes..." Sadhika chimed in, as she put her hand on In-su's, "but what a legacy." He nodded
                his agreement.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Captain Tynes leaned in with a slightly more serious tone and asked: "so... are we serious
                here, I mean like... like <em>really </em>serious about this?"

                Sadhika, In-su, Neil, and Wiremu, were onboard Orbital One overseeing the initial startup of
                the New Horizon Generational Star Ship's prototype fusion core. The New Horizon project had for a few
                years occupied a large office block on the station, and they were now conducting tests from the
                operations room they had constructed for situations such as this; it was their mission control until the
                ship was completed and self-sustaining. The ship's orbital construction was approximately eighty percent
                complete, but all crews had been evacuated during these initial startup tests as a precaution. It was a
                big day for all of them; an important milestone for the project. The New Horizon's fusion core was the
                most sophisticated shipborne power system ever constructed by human beings, and this was to be its first

                    passion. They taught that one should be a creature of reason, and at peace with the order of the
                    universe and one's place within it. Similarly the ancient Taoist, Confucianists, and Buddhists, all
                    preached a fundamental acceptance of the world and one's place within it. They believed that
                    personal and societal peace was only achievable through being in balance with the natural order of
                    the universe, and that disunity with it was the ultimate source of all human suffering.

                All that was available to the technicians were instrument readings since there could be no
                direct video feed of the reactions themselves; the interior of the thick walled reactor was far too hot
                for any kind of camera. Inside the doughnut shaped reaction vessel, powerful magnets began dragging
                hydrogen atoms along at ever faster speeds and pressures to create plasma so hot and dense that the
                protons would fuse, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process. Inside the reaction vessel,
                the plasma swirled hotter and denser as more and more energy was being dumped into the system to achieve
                fusion. Once the reaction began, its energy output could be looped back into sustaining the reaction,
                with tremendous surpluses of energy left over to power all of the ship's systems; such was the marvel of
                fusion technology.

                There were tense moments as the engineers and contractors from Bowland Power Systems checked
                the indicator panels and power readings, looking for any dangerous anomalies that might require a
                precautionary emergency power down. These drives were modern marvels but their initial startup procedure
                could be very difficult, especially with a new prototype. It would be much easier to maintain the

                Earth's magnetic field protected life on its surface against high energy radiation from space, the
                ship's powerful artificial magnetosphere would likewise protect the crew from solar wind generated
                within star systems. More importantly given the nature of the ship's mission though, the field would
                also protect the crew from the silent and invisible high energy cosmic rays which endangered all organic
                life out in the void of deep space.

                The lead technician turned to the famous four leaders of the project. "With your permission,
                we're ready to test fire the engines." Wiremu gave him an acknowledging nod, at which point the
                technician swiveled his chair back to his desk. "Engine Team, go on Engine One power up."

                From Orbital One, the largest space station in orbit around Earth, people were gathering at
                the windows on the floor of the habitat ring to see the big event. Orbital One shared a parallel orbit
                with the New Horizon which allowed a wonderful view of the ship being built from the station. Barely
                perceptible at first, the eerie electric blue jets coming off the first of the four massive ion engines
                appeared and then grew brighter and brighter until a long pale blue jet could be seen out the back of
                the engine. Elemental xenon was being excited electrically until one by one the atoms were allowed to
                fly out the back of the reaction vessel, imparting a minute acceleration onto the giant generational
                starship. Being an ion drive, the light was much more impressive than the thrust, which by design only
                aggregated over time.

                    Abraham Maslow first coined the term 'self-actualization' as being at the very top of
                    his pyramidal hierarchy of human concerns. His idea was that we can only commit our attention to our
                    'higher' concerns once we are satisfied with our 'lower' concerns. At the bottom are our
                    physiological needs, for which we all now find ourselves satisfied with our abundant food, water,
                    heat, and shelter. Then comes safety, which has been satisfied by effectively eliminating war and
                    crime through abundant resource distribution, and compassionate concern for those who do violate our
                    laws or quarantine for those who are unable to understand or follow them.

                "Excellent," the chief technician answered, "okay. Power down engine one, then go on engine
                two power up." The bright jet of engine one diminished more and more until it was entirely gone. Then,
                just as imperceptibly at first, a faint blue jet began to emerge from the rear of engine two.

                A loud alarm suddenly filled the control room, accompanying flashing warnings on many of the
                screens. "What is that?" Wiremu asked.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "<em>Fuck</em>... I'm sorry sir, that's the Earth-bound solar flare alarm." The directions
                in which solar flares burst were quite random, but this particular one just happened to be aimed
                straight at Earth, thus triggering the alarm.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"What's the ETA on the particle wave?" Wiremu asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Um... network reports that it's a fast one sir, only thirty-three minutes."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Hmm. Fuck indeed... Oh well, not much we can do about it now. Power down the reactor and
                lock all of the New Horizon's systems into safe mode. We'll have to call off the tests until the weather
                settles down."

            <p class="lead">
                Solar flares were a known danger in space, but one which could usually be mitigated with
                early warning systems and artificial magnetospheres. Although the New Horizon's field was scheduled to
                be initiated later that day, Orbital One's powerful magnetic field had already protected everyone from
                the photon burst and would likewise protect them from the proton wave when it struck. It was fortunate
                that crews had already been pulled off of the New Horizon during the fusion core startup procedure, but
                even if they had not they would have brought a portable field generator with them regardless. After some
                bad accidents earlier in the space flight era, it had become a New Commonwealth workplace mandate that
                nobody was allowed to work naked to radiation exposure in space.

                The technician stood to face him. "The system is locked into an over-regeneration cycle. I
                can't shut it down!" This meant that more energy was being looped back into the reaction than was needed
                to sustain it, leading to ever higher temperatures and pressures.

                There was silence as they pondered the grim reality of the situation Wiremu described. "What

                "Either problem alone we could deal with, but together... If we try to wait it out New
                Horizon will detonate." A strange unidentifiable noise escaped from In-su after Wiremu said the word
                'detonate.' The idea of so abruptly losing the ship elicited a reaction he couldn't quite contain.
                "Exactly, and what would we do then? We just don't have the resources to just start all over again," he
                added.
