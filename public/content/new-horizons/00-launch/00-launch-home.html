            Whatever else may be good or bad about the show Californication, the one scene that really stuck 
            with me (which I would discuss in polite company), is him talking to his daughter about the first 
            book she wrote.  He was clearly trying to figure out how to diplomatically tell her that it wasn't 
            good.  He said it showed a lot of promise, but that he thought she should put it in a drawer and 
            keep writing.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            That's what should have happened with this book.  It showed a lot of potential, but at the end of 
            the day it was a learning excercise which wound up a disjointed mess, ripped up and rebuilt for years 
            trying to put everything into it whether it fit or not.  Long rambly digressions about points I wanted 
            to make, explaining things I thought were cool, and my solutions to global problems.  The degree to which it is so obviously thinly 
            veiled autobiography is shameful.  There's a good idea buried in there, which I have since realized 
            in Chasing Stars, but the end result was something I resented being the necessary first entry into 
            a larger, better written world.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            So really, don't read this.  You can if you want to for whatever reason, my ego forbids burying it 
            my making it entirely, but it is no longer to be considered as part of the New Horizons series 
            anymore.  It is more of a pseudo master's thesis after completing my university degree in psychology 
            and philosophy and independantly learning just as much about history and sociology.

            This prologue, which I added to the beginning when I republished the entire trilogy as one book, 
            remains even more true and valid today as when I originally wrote it.

            A Note from the Author
            <br><br>
            To read this, is to know the person I was, and the way I viewed the world, in January of 2015.  
            As I learn more and more, there are bits which already make me wince a little, and all too soon 
            there will be parts which elicit an outright cringe.  Although in this edition I correct minor 
            errors and make small wording changes, I leave the content intact and honest to what it was when 
            it was written: an encapsulating snapshot of the mind I was during one singular point in space 
            and time.
            <br>
            Enjoy.

            Launch, the first book, is about a man who grew up with maximum privilege and able to do
            anything with his life, but feels a profound ambivalence which comes from a lack of a driving force in his
            life. Applying to the New Horizons program effectively on a whim, he wins a spot and has to come to
            understand why he finds himself wanting to go, and walk away from his terrestrial obligations to surrender
            all his privilige, and die in deep space for a dream he'll never personally see realized.
