            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;<em>29 Years Ago&hellip;</em></p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus declared to Hugh as they sat on the side of a hill on Vancouver&rsquo;s north shore. &nbsp;They were overlooking downtown Vancouver, and the sounds of the late evening bustle could be heard even at their distant perch. &nbsp;It could only be heard in murmurs though; no individual sounds were discernible. &nbsp; Earlier that day, Markus&rsquo; father had died in a de-orbing accident. &nbsp;A small piece of orbital debris had chipped the ablative ceramic tiles underneath his shuttle just before re-entering the atmosphere, and the ship instantaneously incinerated at some point during their re-entry. 
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Accidents like this used to be much more common before space faring nations got together and conducted the Great Orbital Cleanup of the late twenty-first century. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d always known it would be impossible to get all of the orbiting debris, but they knew they could get enough to make such events far rarer. &nbsp;They succeeded in this regard, and similar accidents only occurred once every few years or so now, though they did still occur. &nbsp;Accidents were infrequent enough, that they were truly shocking when they did happen.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Most shocked by such accidents were of course those directly involved, and Markus was no exception. &nbsp; At nineteen, his life had so far been quite sheltered from death, especially from the sudden and unexpected kind. &nbsp; He was still young and na&iuml;ve enough to have never known death so intimately before. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been under the perfectly natural, though gravely mistaken illusion, that his father would live forever, much like he figured he himself and everyone he knew would live forever. &nbsp;As a child he&rsquo;d been affected by his sister&rsquo;s death, but he didn&rsquo;t experience it in so direct and personal way. &nbsp;No previous experiences in his life had ever compelled him to seriously consider the impermanence of life. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d never experienced before how quickly and abruptly it could all change. &nbsp;Never in his life had there been so dramatic a break between what <em>had</em> been, and what would now be. &nbsp;Today was the first day of his life without a father.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course not Markus&hellip; it&rsquo;s not something anybody should ever have to suffer,&rdquo; Hugh offered. &nbsp;He also had no personal knowledge of death, but he certainly had an appreciation for how dramatically life could change, like when he woke up to a scientific outlook, or when his parents left on the Mormon G.S.S. &nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t really understand what his friend was going through, but he was there for him, in whatever limited capacity he could be. &nbsp;The rawness of the emotional experience shared tonight would further cement a lifelong friendship between the two men. &nbsp;Markus, who found emotional trust so difficult, tonight learned that he could trust Hugh when he was vulnerable.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;He watched as Hugh half-heartedly shuffled around the pebbles and dirt with his feet. &nbsp;There was something else Markus was coming to understood for the first time as well. &nbsp;Beyond simply coming to understand loss, he was discovering what made loss itself so terrible. &nbsp;Everything that he loved about his father was gone, his mind and spirit vanishing as abruptly and unforgivably as his body. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d always been a material humanist, but this was the first time his conviction was brought to bear against the full force of reality.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I think I get it now Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Get what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Faith. &nbsp;I mean&hellip; religion, god, spirituality&hellip; all that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Hugh cautiously asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;It is so <em>hard</em>&hellip; to, to really believe that my father is just gone, that the person I knew and loved is actually&hellip; <em>gone</em>, that he really did just&hellip;&rdquo; he looked up into the dark sky, &ldquo;just <em>incinerate</em> up there&hellip; &nbsp;The idea that <em>any</em> of us could just&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus snapped his fingers as he said &ldquo;<em>Bam!</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;No more Dad! &nbsp;The idea that we&rsquo;re <em>all</em> so&hellip; so transitory! &nbsp;So illusory! &nbsp; It just seems so&hellip; so <em>implausible&nbsp;</em>that something so&hellip; so vital and so animated could just be&hellip; just <em>brain!</em>&nbsp; That it <em>could</em> be just a&hellip; just a complex of neurons, that the mind could really be just as impermanent as the body&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus plumbed the depths of this understanding as he looked down at his own hands.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well, yes&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Hugh carefully clarified. &nbsp;The spontaneous adoption of a religion was as rare as de-orbing accidents were, but the probability of both occurrences always remained non-zero. &nbsp; Markus was no exception.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No, no&hellip; of course not. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m just saying that I&hellip; I think I understand the psychology better.&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus noticed that Hugh had turned away and was shaking his head.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Your father just died&hellip; and you&rsquo;re already trying to figure out what you can learn from it. &nbsp;I suppose it&rsquo;s often when we hurt the most&hellip; that we have the clearest opportunities to learn. &nbsp; Most people don&rsquo;t have it in them to exploit the opportunity&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;During Hugh&rsquo;s own time of intense turmoil and conflict a few years earlier, Markus had helped Hugh see what he could learn and how he could grow from it.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Markus didn&rsquo;t answer. &nbsp;Instead he held up his hands and looked through his fingers at the city outstretched before them, and then dropped his hands dejectedly. &nbsp;It was fully night time now, and the lights of the city were mesmerizing. &nbsp;Looking out on the city, he thought about how abruptly anyone&rsquo;s life could be extinguished, without any ultimate cause or according to anyone&rsquo;s agenda. &nbsp;He thought about the impermanence of everything, of humanity, and of the Earth itself.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;That must be why they had to leave&hellip; the Mormons I mean,&rdquo; Markus offered as he turned to look at Hugh. &nbsp; The Mormon G.S.S. had left several years ago, but the Catholic mission had only been announced a few months ago. &nbsp; &ldquo;Their collective delusions simply couldn&rsquo;t survive the modern information epoch&hellip; they&rsquo;d been slowly dying for generations. &nbsp;Reality was encroaching on their beliefs&hellip; threatening to kill their dead. &nbsp;All of them who believed in an afterlife&hellip; it was really always just an escape from the pain they felt when a loved one died&hellip; a way to forever deny the oh so bitter realities of that death&hellip; of all death. &nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t ever be saved from their religion, because in their minds only their faith in it saved their loved ones from <em>complete</em> death&hellip; it allowing them to stay alive in some perverted way. 
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;To break from their delusions&hellip; to truly accept mortality, and to <em>really</em> suffer the aching&hellip; <em>unrepentant</em> sadness that I feel now&hellip; was just too much for them to accept&hellip; too much to burden their children with&hellip; so they left. &nbsp;That ship wasn&rsquo;t just an artificial environment for their biological systems Hugh&hellip; it was an artificial environment for their faith as well. &nbsp;Out there, protected from the world it could survive, unmolested by evidence or heretical facts. &nbsp;A physically removed and intellectually insulated generational starship&hellip; it was the <em>only</em> remaining environment in which mass delusions <em>could&nbsp;</em>persist&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Hugh looked at Markus while he gazed out over the city, but he eventually turned to take in the view himself as well. &nbsp;They sat that way in silence together for some time, each lost in their own thoughts. &nbsp; Being perfectly comfortable in silence together was a hallmark of their friendship; neither ever felt responsible for keeping the other entertained. &nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think they were right to go?&rdquo; Hugh finally asked, &ldquo;or just crazy?&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus chewed on this for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip; no, not <em>crazy</em> Hugh&hellip; just wrong. &nbsp;In fact I think they were quite rational in their own way, at least&hellip; from a certain point of view. &nbsp;They were just wrong on some basic premises about life, the universe, and everything&hellip; and much of what they extrapolated <em>based</em> on those bad premises was wrong in turn. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re <em>rational</em>, just&hellip; just wrong, and absolutely committed to the wrong things they believe&hellip; &nbsp;I think there&rsquo;s a little bit of that in all of us; everyone has quiet little lies they tell themselves to hide some truths from themselves... &nbsp;They were just <em>really</em> committed, to some <em>really&nbsp;</em>big lie&hellip;&rdquo; 
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The digression into a subject which fascinated him granted Markus an ever so brief reprieve from his grief. &nbsp; He had just begun the long intellectual journey which would ultimately lead him to the New Horizon. &nbsp;That fall he had started his first year of university, and he was finding himself increasingly interested in the mind. &nbsp; After today, after trying to resolve this sudden confrontation with the impermanence of existence, he would develop a concurrent interest in philosophy, and come to integrate the two in his own unique ways.</p>
            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;His respite ended, his misery returned again in full force and he began to cry. &nbsp;Hugh put his arm around his friend&rsquo;s shoulder. &nbsp;It was a gesture Markus would ordinarily recoil from, but in his grief he hardly noticed. &nbsp;They sat together in silence as the lights of the city blinked and twinkled at them, and Markus blinked back at the city through tears.</p>
