            <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Soon after leaving Molly&rsquo;s place, Markus found himself back at Hugh&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Lavinia was still there, and they were both clearly, if reservedly, eager to hear how it had gone for him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Hugh winced. &nbsp;&ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo; 
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Markus hesitated for only half a moment, and then told Hugh and Lavinia everything that had happened with his mother and her strange request, as well as Amber&rsquo;s bombshell about making herself pregnant using a sample of Markus&rsquo; skin cells. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t see any point to mentioning his visit with Molly. &nbsp; Hugh was touched and torn when hearing about his mother, and then absolutely mortified and befuddled over the news about Amber.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What&hellip; does this mean to you?&rdquo; he asked, seeming to restrain a rather strong emotional response.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Markus answered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s tempting in its own way.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;Hugh appeared as though he were about to choke. &nbsp;&ldquo;You could actually consider staying for that, <em>with&nbsp;</em>her? &nbsp;I mean I can understand if you felt some sort of obligation to the child&hellip; &nbsp;I&rsquo;d still tell you you&rsquo;re fucking wrong; I&rsquo;d argue with you but at least that I&rsquo;d <em>understand</em>! &nbsp;But for you to actually be considering <em>staying</em> here to be with <em>her</em>?? &nbsp; This I can&rsquo;t understand at <em>all</em>!!&rdquo; &nbsp;Hugh collapsed onto the couch behind him. &nbsp;He appeared exhausted, visibly depleted from his intoxication last night. &nbsp; In the state he was in this seemed to be just too much for him to handle with his usual grace.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know. &nbsp; You&rsquo;ve never understood us though&hellip; &nbsp; I see no reason why you would start now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;If you allow yourself to be taken in by this&hellip; this <em>ultimate</em> manipulation, if you&hellip; well that is a choice that <em>you</em> make.&rdquo; 
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Lavinia was quiet. &nbsp;She looked very much alert and had listened intently so far, but had yet to say anything.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Markus answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s trying to manipulate me this time Hugh. &nbsp;She was very clear&hellip; very emphatic about it really, that she only did it once she thought she&rsquo;d never see me again and that she wasn&rsquo;t sure she would ever tell me about it at all&hellip; &nbsp;I really don&rsquo;t think that she made herself pregnant as a manipulation technique, though telling me now certainly may be&hellip; &nbsp;But I really do believe her that she just&hellip; that she just thought it was information that I ought to know if I was to do a serious reconsidering of my decision to launch.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never understand you two Markus.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;There was silence for several moments. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to stay?&rdquo; Hugh asked.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You could help Brakus adjust to keeping the company running without your mother&hellip; you could live with Amber&hellip; fuck you could even raise your child<em>&nbsp;with</em> her&hellip; and hey, you and I could even still go to Alberta every summer&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hugh&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus didn&rsquo;t think he needed this right now, but maybe he did. &nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s precisely why he&rsquo;d come back here. &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s why Hugh was his best friend.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;And then in twenty years,&rdquo; Hugh continued, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be seventy four; probably <em>sick</em> of Amber by then, and <em>bitter</em> about having missed your one big chance in life to be part of something <em>truly&nbsp;</em>special and larger than yourself. &nbsp;<em>And</em>, you&rsquo;ll have a <em>kid!</em>&nbsp; <em>You!!</em>&nbsp; A kid you never wanted, a kid who will be around whether you stay or go&hellip; &nbsp;Ask <em>that</em> guy what you should do now, today.&rdquo; &nbsp;Hugh had more in him, but he let it go at that.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Thanks Hugh&hellip; I probably needed to hear that,&rdquo; Markus admitted. &nbsp;There were again several moments of silence in the room, with Markus lost in thought, and Hugh left to wonder what those thoughts might be. &nbsp;&ldquo;If only you could go instead of me!&rdquo; &nbsp;Markus offered brightly.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yeah right,&rdquo; Hugh retorted, &ldquo;and have you blame <em>me</em> the rest of your miserable terrestrial existence for taking your place? &nbsp; I think not!&rdquo; &nbsp;The two chuckled a bit, but it was half-hearted. &nbsp;Lavinia didn&rsquo;t laugh at all.
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go,&rdquo; Markus stated, &ldquo;I told Brakus I&rsquo;d have dinner with him and his family tonight. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re all going to go visit my mother again tomorrow morning and&hellip; well for me I guess it&rsquo;ll be my last chance if we&rsquo;re catching that three p.m. orb-up.&rdquo; 
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Before you go Markus,&rdquo; Lavinia finally said, &ldquo;can I have a word with you alone please?&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;The two made their way out of Hugh&rsquo;s apartment and up to the roof of his building. &nbsp;Up here there was the community garden for the residents of the high rise, and a remarkable view of the city. &nbsp;The sky was bright blue with sparse clouds, which clashed uncomfortably with Markus&rsquo; internal emotional state.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Where do new species come from Markus?&rdquo; &nbsp;The old woman asked as they slowly walked the path around the perimeter of the roof.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Markus considered, &ldquo;it happens&hellip; when one part of a species&rsquo; population is somehow permanently separated from the rest, resulting in two independent breeding populations. &nbsp;After being separated, their different environments promote a divergence in their genetic adaptations to the point that they can no longer successfully interbreed and produce reproductively healthy offspring.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Right, and is this the&hellip; only phenomenon which follows this pattern?&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;That was a really good question which he had to chew over for a few moments. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I suppose you could say the same thing about culture, but it&rsquo;s&hellip; not really the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Lavinia pressed.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What are you talking about&hellip; <em>cultural</em> speciation?&rdquo; &nbsp;He looked out towards the horizon in the direction of Vancouver Island. &nbsp; A thick cloud passed in front of the sun, leaving everything in shadow. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you mean like&hellip; when a culture differentiates from a parent culture&hellip; &nbsp; Like the way the culture of the United States diverged from the culture of Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Lavinia shook her head. &nbsp; &ldquo;Yes of course but that is too obvious and too <em>literal&nbsp;</em>an example. &nbsp;Besides, those two cultures are really just variations on a theme, no real <em>difference&nbsp;</em>between the two.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; Markus frowned. &nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Western and far Eastern civilizations were incredibly different from each other&hellip; &nbsp;All of the early civilizations were founded on their own unique principles of culture. &nbsp;They were about as alien as civilizations could be to one another amongst the same species on the same planet. &nbsp;With globalization though, they&rsquo;re all essentially homogenized now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; Lavinia acceded. &nbsp;&ldquo;They were civilizations entirely separated from each other and they developed into rather different ones right from the beginning&hellip; but what about a more dramatic break and shift, can you identify an equivalent schism which took place over only a few generations?&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The Protestant Revolution?&rdquo; he asked, once again and still her student.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Closer yes, closer&hellip; &nbsp; Revolutions in <em>thought</em> are what change the world Markus. &nbsp;How many wars have been fought over encouraging or inhibiting an evolution in thought? &nbsp;Many child&hellip; too many, perhaps even all the wars since the beginning of time. &nbsp;But that one point in history, the Protestant Revolution, that was when in the Western sphere it became acceptable to think <em>independently</em> about one&rsquo;s faith and to <em>criticize</em> the authority&rsquo;s interpretation of scripture and dogma. &nbsp;This revolution inspired more and more people to study, and to figure out things for themselves. &nbsp;For the first time in countless generations of Western Civilization, there was a group of people who didn&rsquo;t want to simply receive knowledge passively without any vigorous challenge and engagement with it.&rdquo; 
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;With this evolution in thought,&rdquo; Livonia continued, &ldquo;the modern sciences were born in what we call the Enlightenment, and all the other wonders of the modern age.&rdquo; &nbsp;She put a cigarette to her mouth and lit it, taking a long and deep draw off of it. &nbsp;Holding it in her lungs, she eventually blew it out evenly and slowly with obvious satisfaction. &nbsp;He found it amazing that she could still do that without erupting into hacking and coughing fits.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s never been able to&hellip; well, &lsquo;culturate&rsquo; I guess would be the word,&rdquo; Markus offered. &nbsp;&ldquo;That part of humanity has never had the chance to&hellip; to really partition itself from the parts of humanity which hold it back.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Precisely. &nbsp;That is of course, until this mission which you claim to care so much about.&rdquo; &nbsp;The cloud which had obscured the sun passed on and the sun once again brightly lit everything up. &nbsp;Lavinia stopped and took a seat on one of the benches lining the path. &nbsp;&ldquo;Markus&hellip; here on Earth, the weak will <em>always</em> plague the likes of you, all of you up there on that ship. &nbsp;Here on Earth they drag you down because they are <em>jealous</em> of you, but up there, on that ship,&rdquo; she looked up into the sky, &ldquo;only the exceptional are going. &nbsp;You will urge each other on to further and further greatness&hellip; and I think that&rsquo;s very special.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You have to wonder,&rdquo; Markus commented, &ldquo;if the same balance of weak and exceptional will only re-emerge after a few generations, if that&rsquo;ll be a problem they run into&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;There is no question that they will.&rdquo; Lavinia stated.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Markus continued to look at her for a few moments, and then turned his gaze back to the view of the city. &nbsp;&ldquo;They plague us&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated. &nbsp;The way she had said it had disturbed him for some reason, but he could find no fault in the appropriateness of her phrasing.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;Lavinia stood up tall and straight, as much as she could that is, at only a hundred and sixty-two centimeters tall. &nbsp;She clasped her hands behind her back and stretched out, arching her back. &nbsp;She then walked over to the edge of the building and leaned over to look down at the street below. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not their fault you know, Markus&hellip; they don&rsquo;t deserve any blame. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply who&hellip; and what they are. &nbsp; They&rsquo;re no more responsible for that than you are for being the way <em>you</em> are.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned to face Markus again. &nbsp;&ldquo;They are what we <em>used</em> to be child, but <em>we&nbsp;</em>are something<em>&nbsp;new.</em>&nbsp; And for us to thrive we <em>must</em>&hellip; or at least <em>some&nbsp;</em>of us must&hellip; well, launch.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You must leave this world, Markus. &nbsp;You have a sacred duty to honour both what you come from, as well as what you have become. &nbsp; You are in a classic double bind, the same double blind which has always existed in the heart of humanity,&rdquo; she poked him in the chest, &ldquo;and in the heart of every <em>man</em>. &nbsp;To leave dishonours your blood kin and offends your community, but to stay dishonours yourself, and forbids you from ever finding the community in which you <em>truly</em> belong. &nbsp;What is more important, that from which you come from, or that of which you <em>are</em>?&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I have to dishonor my family or my community&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Does what Amber told you <em>really</em> change anything Markus? &nbsp;Is leaving a child you neither created nor asked for before its life has even begun, really any worse than leaving your nieces and nephews while they&rsquo;re growing up. &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that in some ways even worse? &nbsp;<em>They</em> will have to suffer actually <em>losing&nbsp;</em>you. &nbsp;That abomination Amber created will <em>not</em>. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m worried about you Markus, I know what you&rsquo;re like, I know that news got to you, please don&rsquo;t let it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I really did love being on that ship Lavinia, it was like a whole ship of people&hellip; well, people like you and Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Of course! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a ship <em>full</em> of people like us! &nbsp;But you absolutely <em>cannot</em> forget that <em>we</em> are the <em>uncommon</em> ones Markus. &nbsp;<em>We</em> are the anomalies here on Earth child, not them. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you dare ever <em>forget&nbsp;</em>that.&rdquo; &nbsp;Lavinia pulled a fresh cigarette out of her case and lit it with the still lit butt of her previous cigarette. &nbsp;She then tossed the lit butt off of the roof and down to the street below, much to Markus&rsquo; horror. &nbsp;&ldquo;Up on that ship of yours... <em>everyone</em> there is like us, and they are collectively going to be the parents of a <em>whole new</em> <em>civilization</em> Markus&hellip; and <em>you</em> have been asked to play a <em>central</em> <em>role&nbsp;</em>in that great epic. &nbsp;You are to be father to a whole new branch of humanity, to build a new way for human beings to exist, with an infant human civilization starting from the best possible ingredients. &nbsp;That is more important than&hellip; than legitimizing what Amber has done to you.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;At that Lavinia simply hugged Markus tightly, something which was quite uncharacteristic for either of them, but which seemed unavoidably necessary in this particular moment and he hugged her back. &nbsp;She pulled away and they faced each other. &nbsp;Lavinia put her hands on his shoulders and looked up, straight into his eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whether or not they are able to see it for themselves with their narrow perspectives Markus; only one path available to you truly honours your community here on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;She turned back and looked out over the city again. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come so far&hellip; &nbsp;I remember when you first walked into my class, you were as vacant as any of the rest of my students, and just as oblivious as they were to what I was really trying to teach them. &nbsp;But something changed in you when your father died. &nbsp;It was your first violent shock out of your complacency. &nbsp;It was your first spark of conscientiousness about the world around you&hellip; it was for you the equivalent of what Hugh experienced in losing his family the way he did.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You came to me as the last man, the ultimate man, the very spirit of your age&hellip; a man no more imaginative than most of the rest of your pathetic generation. &nbsp;You seemed tired of life, seeking only your own peace and comfort which would forever elude you&hellip; but that day you started fighting your way out of that box. &nbsp;You had painfully slow progress over the decades and I was worried that I&rsquo;d die before you broke free of the world as you understood it the way Hugh did. &nbsp;I was worried that you would be a slave forever. &nbsp; It killed me to know what potential you had, and to see you just killing time, just&hellip; waiting to be dead.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Waiting to be dead&hellip;&rdquo; Markus repeated reflexively.</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s changed in you now though, I can feel it. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve taken a great leap towards becoming something more than just human, more than just a man. &nbsp;Being on that ship has changed you, I can feel it. &nbsp;The power you are only beginning to learn how to harness&hellip; scares me a little, and it&rsquo;s wonderful. &nbsp;Humanity is something meant to be overcome, Markus. &nbsp;Earth is something meant to be left behind. &nbsp;Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="lead">&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;You have the opportunity to play father to a whole new civilization, and you must seize it. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t, well&hellip;&rdquo; she sighed heavily, &ldquo;well then I&rsquo;m glad I won&rsquo;t be around much longer to see everything I love about you, and all the potential I see in you, slowly atrophy, wither away, and die.&rdquo;</p>
