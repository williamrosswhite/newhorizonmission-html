        <div class="text-left">
            <p class="lead">The year was 516.</p>
            <p class="lead">Well, actually there was some debate about that. Some people still chose to use the original
                Earth
                calendar would make the year 2839, but they were rather in the minority, and they became irritated if
                the
                similar arbitrariness of that calendar's original day zero was pointed out to them. Kathryn
                Barnes herself felt that of all the possible arbitrary starting dates for their calendar, the day which
                their ancestors first arrived on the planet Haven seemed most appropriate if one had to be picked. It
                was after all a rather hard and undeniable boundary plane in their history.</p>
            <p class="lead">As big as that day must have been for them so long ago though, today was the biggest day in
                history which
                Kathryn herself would ever be lucky enough to witness (or so she thought), and she was sufficiently
                blessed
                to have a critical and central role in it. She was to be the first person ever to be launched into
                space after her civilization had lost the ability to do so less than a century after their arrival on
                the
                planet Haven.</p>
            <p class="lead">The generational ship which her ancestors had arrived in was still in orbit, but it had been
                abandoned there
                since they had lost the ability to return to it. It was kept operational in a support role to those on
                the surface for as long as was possible, but it came time to abandon it the very last of its fuel was
                used
                to boost it up to a high enough orbit that it would be preserved there for eons. It served as an ever
                present reminder to the people of Haven that they had come to this planet from another, and that it was
                their inalienable destiny to return to the stars once again.</p>
            <p class="lead">It was her destiny to return there today; she was the first. Test missions had demonstrated
                the
                capacity of their new rocketry to get her there, and another person had already conducted low orbit
                tests,
                but it was her and her alone who would be remembered by her people forever as the first person to step
                foot
                on the New Horizon again after it had been abandoned so long ago.</p>
            <p class="lead">Docking with it had been tricky. Although it was in a stable orbit, over the centuries it
                had worked up
                a multi axis spin which she had to account for. It had been a tense moment, but she had successfully
                latched her capsule to the moving docking hatch. Once secured, her vessel lazily spun along with the
                much larger craft it was connected to.</p>
            <p class="lead">She held her breath, and then pushed herself across the threshold. Her capsule was trying to
                transfer
                sufficient power to allow the space ship to reinitialize basic things like emergency lighting, but it
                hadn't worked yet. So far, the powerful lights on either side of her helmet and ambient light
                from the interior of her own spacecraft were all that provided any illumination. If the ship were
                operational, there would be simulated gravity up on the rotating habitat ring, but down in the
                engineering
                section where the docking ports were located, no such simulated gravity had ever been designed.</p>
            <p class="lead">Holding onto a railing, she breathed again. She absorbed the gravity of her situation, of
                holding a
                piece of the legendary ship in her hands, and of having such a tactile connection with her ancestors.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Commander Barnes?</em></p>
            <p class="lead">I'm good, everything is good up here, I'm just overwhelmed.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>That's understandable, but we're reporting to you that we've just had an
                    unscheduled black out and we're considering cutting your mission short.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">A black out Kathryn echoed back in curiosity. She certainly hadn't seen
                that coming. Like clockwork, blackouts had occurred every one year, six days, eight hours, three
                minutes and forty-two seconds for almost a hundred years now. One occurring out of that schedule
                was well, as mysterious as them happening at all. It was an unexplained phenomenon which
                had begun hundreds of years after they arrived on Haven and which no accepted scientific theory could
                explain. Every one years, six days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds, their sun
                darkened for exactly seven point three eight seconds. It didn't happen completely, but it was
                enough that it made one able to continuously look at their sun with the naked eye during that time
                without
                permanent damage.</p>
            <p class="lead">The last blackout was only a little under a month ago though, and why one should occur
                outside of such a
                regular schedule was as mysterious as the regular schedule itself or the phenomenon overall.</p>
            <p class="lead">You really think that's necessary? Kathryn asked.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>There are too many unknowns Barnes; we are dealing with an unknown disruption in the
                    schedule of
                    an unknown spatial phenomenon.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">I'm here. I prefer to stay. I'll return if you order me to of course or if
                something else comes of the phenomenon, but I don't see any connection. We know there's no
                radiological risks of a blackout; in fact it only reduces the solar radiation while it's
                occurring. I think my carrying on is an acceptable risk.</p>
            <p class="lead">She waited anxiously while the team back at mission control reviewed their options. She'd
                been
                training for this and excited about it for a long time. It would be such a profound disappointment to
                have to turn back now.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Barnes we're going to let you proceed but only provisionally. If anything else
                    happens, even if its meaning is ambiguous we're going to recall you, but barring that we're
                    going to allow you to proceed.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">Thank you, she said with a smile, and continued to pull herself down the engineering central
                access corridor. It was her first time in authentic micro gravity, and she was enjoying the sensation
                of floating as she gently pushed herself off of one railing after another. She reached the central hub
                where the long cylinder of the engineering section met the spokes which suspended the habitat ring about
                it,
                and which was designed to rotate around to simulate gravity in the living areas of the ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">She shone her helmet light down each of the four spokes one at a time, but all four looked
                identical.</p>
            <p class="lead">I'm at the central hub she reported as she observed the markings which labeled
                which tube was which. Proceeding down tube three towards the bridge as planned.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Understood.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">As she started to push herself down the access tube, her radio broke in again. <em>Barnes
                    get
                    out now.</em> </p>
            <p class="lead">Understood. It was a direct and unambiguous order; she had to act on it without question.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">On her way back to her capsule, her team filled her in. <em>We had another unscheduled black
                    out, twelve minutes after the previous one. We still don't know what it means, but
                    there's definitely something going on and we just can't have you up there and
                    exposed.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">I understand. She was disappointed, but she did understand. They would have been
                perfectly within their rights to have recalled her after the first unexpected blackout. She was lucky
                to have gotten as far as she did. She was lucky to be there at all. Whatever came next, she was
                first onboard again, and her people's history would remember her as long as they remembered
                anybody. Still, she'd really hoped to have seen so much more. Maybe they'd let her
                come back.</p>
            <p class="lead">Before she floated back into her capsule, she noticed that the display panel just beyond the
                airlock was
                activated, and displayed on it was an incoming communication request. She didn't know what to
                make of it. Her own people certainly wouldn't contact her this way, and the power transfer to
                the ship from her capsule was never intended to power up the ship's onboard comm system. Who
                else could it be?</p>
            <p class="lead">And yet, there it was, an unexpected and impossible incoming comm request, just as
                mysterious as the
                blackouts and the interruption of their otherwise clockwork schedule. Could there be a connection?</p>
            <p class="lead">Tynes, I'm outside of the airlock to my capsule, and I'm I'm seeing an
                incomming comm request on the airlock panel. It's weird that system shouldn't have
                any power, there's nobody who should be making such a call, and yet there it is. I want
                to answer it and see what happens. </p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Please hold</em>, her liaison at Tynes Spaceflight Centre requested while the occurrence
                she'd reported was discussed. It certainly wouldn't be difficult to accept the call,
                although the New Horizons systems were optimized for thought control via devices which used to be known
                as
                Brainchips installed in every adolescent. Her own people were still many years away from recreating
                that level of neurocybernetics.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Barnes we're going to allow you to proceed. We are all watching your helmet's
                    video feed very carefully down here.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">Nodding, she reached out to touch the answer button on the panel where it indicated, but
                just before her
                finger reached the panel, the comm request ended. With a furrowed brow she lowered her thickly gloved
                hand to her side with some confusion. She then nearly leapt out of her space suit when the comm
                request lit up again. After composing herself, taking a moment to laugh at herself a little as she did
                so, she reached out to touch the screen again.</p>
            <p class="lead">A strikingly attractive male face appeared on the screen. His strong jaw was clean shaven
                and he
                appeared to be a man in his late forties. His brown hair was neither particularly long or short, but
                was neatly cut, and he was wearing a crisp button up white shirt. </p>
            <p class="lead">Greetings, the man offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">Greetings, she tentatively offered in return without any idea what else to say. She was
                speechless not only at the look of him, but his mysterious presence on the comm panel at all.</p>
            <p class="lead">My name is Jaren. I've come from the Eta Cassiopeiae system. </p>
            <p class="lead">Eta Cassioeiae, she muttered in repetition as she looked down through her face plate
                fishbowl
                for the significance of those words. The fact that there were other humans out there was not any kind
                of shock or unknown to Kathryn. It was well understood that her people had come from the planet humans
                had originally evolved on, and they'd always known there had been other colony missions before and
                probably even after their own. The thing was, since before her people had even landed on Haven,
                they'd lost contact with Earth and had never been able to establish contact with any other colonies
                around other stars.</p>
            <p class="lead">Where are you? Kathryn finally asked. She'd managed to compose herself and refocus
                on the job. Where are you transmitting from? How did you power and access the New
                Horizon?</p>
            <p class="lead">I er, we are in your star system, Jaren answered. My small crew and I are on our
                way to your planet to say hello. We've visited your system before, but we've never made
                contact before. We didn't want to disturb your development, but you've reached the
                point at which we decided to wait until before formally making contact.</p>
            <p class="lead">And what point was that?</p>
            <p class="lead">When you were able to reach the New Horizon again. We left monitoring equipment here which
                let
                us know when you'd managed to accomplish this.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Ask him how he learned of this if he had to wait for a signal to be sent back to his own
                    star
                    system</em>. Tynes Control demanded in hers ear.</p>
            <p class="lead">How were you able to find out so fast? She was instinctively suspicious of him.
                Maybe it was her training. Maybe it was her instincts as a woman to second guess someone she was
                attracted to. For whatever reason her eyes were perpetually somewhat narrowed in her scrutiny of
                him. Wait, for that matter how did you get here so fast after finding out?</p>
            <p class="lead">We have a technology which allows us to open up portals between stars. We call it the Escher
                Rift. By harnessing the power output of an entire star for several seconds, and then redirecting it to
                a particular point in space, we're able to open an Escher which allows us to instantaneously
                communicate or send a ship through.</p>
            <p class="lead">The blackouts she suddenly understood, and could hear some commotion back on Haven as
                other people down at Tynes had the same realization.</p>
            <p class="lead">The whatnow?</p>
            <p class="lead">We we call them blackouts; our sun dims for seven point three eight seconds every one year,
                six days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds. That's been your doing all
                along?</p>
            <p class="lead">Mmm, afraid so, yes. We're very sorry if that disturbed or concerned you, but the specific
                time is just the precise length of a year on our planet. We programmed our monitoring devices to rift
                home a yearly update on your status.</p>
            <p class="lead">And the two unexpected ones today were your drone reporting new activity and then you coming
                through
                in a ship.</p>
            <p class="lead">Correct.</p>
            <p class="lead">Well, that certainly that explains a lot. </p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren just smiled broadly and Kathryn had to look away or start smiling like an idiot
                herself in
                response. I need to consult with my people, she told him as she pretended to be looking
                down at a communications device which didn't exist. Please send another comm request like
                you did before in two minutes alright?</p>
            <p class="lead">Absolutely. The panel screen returned to its inactive standby status.</p>
            <p class="lead">Well Tynes, what do you think? she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>It certainly explains the blackouts</em>, a different voice affirmed in her helmet.
                It was the voice of the Flight Director Krantz himself. <em>Finally</em>, he added with
                a deliberate note of irritation.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Barnes we need to know what they're here for, what they want</em>, he instructed
                her. <em>We also need to know if they know anything about what happened to Earth, and how many
                    other colonies are out there</em>. <em>There's so much to ask We need to find
                    out how their Escher technology works and how we can develop it for ourselves. If they can do that
                    there has to be other technologies they've developed that we could get our hands on, not to
                    mention their military capabilities and intentions</em>.</p>
            <p class="lead">Okay, okay, I get it. She was frustrated with his seemingly aimless musing. As the
                panel lit up again with another comm request she said to Krantz: let's just start with asking
                what they want from us She touched the panel again to system open the channel.</p>
            <p class="lead">Why are you here? she asked with deliberate assertiveness. She was trying to balance
                diplomacy with the subtlest of undertones of confident aggression. It was the same tone she put on
                when she had to be harsh with male underlings she thought didn't adequately respect a female
                superior. What exactly do you want from us? Why exactly did it matter to you when we
                reached this ship again?</p>
            <p class="lead">He seemed a little taken aback at her assertiveness and she was pleased, she'd wanted to put
                him back
                on his heels just a bit. Attractive as he was, she'd grown increasingly uncomfortable with the
                power imbalance of him having all the answers and her only questions.</p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren leaned back in his chair, put his elbows up on his armrests and laced his fingers. He
                let out a
                sigh. We want many things er, I'm sorry what did you say your name was?</p>
            <p class="lead">I didn't, she informed him with a quickly darted up right eyebrow and flash of a smug
                smile. Power balance restored, she happily thought to herself. But it's Barnes.
                Commander Barnes of the Haven United Forces.</p>
            <p class="lead">Commander, he acknowledged her with a nod. We seek friendship, open contact, and
                collaboration with your world.</p>
            <p class="lead">Un hunh, she grunted dismissively. And that's all? She asked.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">No, he admitted with pursed lips. We also want access to the New Horizon's
                archives.</p>
            <p class="lead">Thank you for being honest. Tell me why.</p>
            <p class="lead">My people well, we quite regrettably and short sightedly declined to take most of
                Earth's history or cultural heritage with us on our generational starship when we originally set
                out. We they, didn't think it was important, but well, they were
                wrong. She found herself a little touched at how sincerely sad he seemed to be at this profound
                error of his forebears. We have made contact with one other colony since we've developed
                the rift technology, but unfortunately they made a similar error when they left. We tried looking for
                answers back on Earth itself, but he shook his head and looked away in apparent sadness, or
                at least further disappointment.</p>
            <p class="lead">Wait, you've been back to Earth? What did you find?? What had happened to
                Earth, why it had gone dark halfway through their journey to Haven was the greatest mystery of all on
                her
                planet, the impetus of immeasurable amount of speculation, fear, and storytelling ever since.</p>
            <p class="lead">Well we found humans for sure, but certainly not much in the way of civilization. There
                had been no efforts made to preserve Earth history long term and without an active civilization around
                to
                curate information, all records disappeared as all digital storage media inevitably became corrupted.
                As such there is only known to us one remaining repository of all of the history, art, and culture
                of Earth as it was in the entire universe</p>
            <p class="lead">New Horizon's physical archives she marvelled. Of course. For her own
                people it was a primary prize on the ship but she could see how it could be even more so for Jaren's
                people if they'd brought none of it along. All digital storage media on the surface had degraded
                beyond repair long before they'd learned how to recreate anything comparable, but they'd had it
                at one point, and a significant amount of it had been preserved through copied out physical texts or
                oral
                history and other forms of preservation. She could see though how empty a fog the past would seem
                without any of the information there to be preserved at all in the first place.</p>
            <p class="lead">Exactly. The New Horizon's physical archives. Your founders were very wise.
                They had the foresight not only to take with them all of the wisdom and knowledge of Earth, but to
                preserve
                it in so robust a way that it could survive unpowered and in a vacuum effectively for eternity. To
                us those archives have taken on something of a mystical quality; like the wisdom and
                knowledge of the ancients. His demeanor seemed to reveal his genuine reverence. She could
                almost swear she could detect the slightest mistiness in his eyes as he spoke of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">You could have just taken it from us at any time though could you not? Or even probably copy
                it
                and leave again without us ever knowing. Why didn't you?</p>
            <p class="lead">Because it's yours, he said with a shrug. That's just not our
                way. It would be disrespectful somehow of those who created it, not to mention your people, the
                legitimate heirs of it. It belongs to you; it's <em>your</em> legacy, <em>your</em> endowment as
                a people, not ours. Now that you are ready though, now that you have taken this great technological
                leap, we are here to offer you a trade. </p>
            <p class="lead">Go on</p>
            <p class="lead">We want to make a copy of the entire archives, and in exchange for your permission to do so,
                we are
                prepared to offer you access to our Escher Rift system. You can use it to visit us, the Delta Pavonis
                colony, Earth or any of the uninhabited systems our drones have been able to set up the local
                infrastructure, or will in the future.</p>
            <p class="lead">That's quite an offer, Kathryn conceded while trying to keep her considerable
                excitement in check. As a person oriented towards excitement, adventure, and discovery, this was all
                quite literally a dream coming true.</p>
            <p class="lead">We certainly hoped it would be enticing, Jaren said with a warm but knowing smile.</p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn looked down and to her right while listening to distant voices debate how they
                should proceed.
                Finally a single voice clearly broke through the din. It was Krantz. <em>Tell him we
                    accept in principle, and ask him how he suggests we proceed</em>.</p>
            <p class="lead">We are willing to accept your offer in, she reiterated. Given that, how do you
                suggest that we proceed?</p>
            <p class="lead">Jaren smiled even wider at the good news. Well, he answered, it would be too
                onerous for us to bring all of the equipment we would need all the way here. We would like to
                refurbish the New Horizon for you as a gesture of our good will. We would fuel and restart all of the
                power systems, update and restart the fusion core, magnetic shield, ion engines we'd get the
                habitat ring spinning again to get you some gravity, and even rebuild the arboretum and the rest of your
                life support system, the works.</p>
            <p class="lead">This was beyond her imagining. Hew own people had technologically slid backwards quite
                considerably
                after their arrival on Haven, and were only now rediscovering basic rocketry. They'd hoped to
                learn much from studying the engineering of New Horizon and pouring through its archives, but the idea
                of
                refurbishing the ship and setting sail in it again was dreamt of only by the maddest among them. It
                was more an artefact to them than a vessel, a dead tomb as opposed to a sleeping marvel.</p>
            <p class="lead">You could help us and learn along the way, he added, and when we're all done you
                can re-commission the ship and use it however you wish. It would be your gateway to the rift system
                until you develop another vehicle, and you could explore your own system and others through the rift
                system. But first, while you enjoy all the lavish trappings of an official diplomatic visit with us,
                we would get to work very carefully and methodically copying all of the information stored in the
                archives.</p>
            <p class="lead">Where are you in our system at this point? Kathryn asked him as casually as possible, still
                trying to keep her nearly bursting excitement contained until the end of the conversation.</p>
            <p class="lead">We are still quite near to your star. Eschers can only be initiated very near to one. We
                have rather effective engines, but it will still take us approximately six of your days to arrive at
                your
                planet.</p>
            <p class="lead">We call it Haven, Kathryn remarked with a larger note of pride than she'd expected from
                herself at relaying her home's name to him.</p>
            <p class="lead">Of course, he conceded with a deferential smile, and tell your people not to
                worry. We are a small ship on a diplomatic mission, and there are only four of us. Though
                advanced, our vessel has limited armaments and one of your nuclear tipped missile could easily destroy
                us. We are not a threat to any of your people.</p>
            <p class="lead">I understand, and I will relay your message. How do we proceed?</p>
            <p class="lead">As I said, it will take us six days to reach you. Our ship has the capacity to freely land
                and
                return to orbit, so we can meet you on the surface if your people don't have the capacity or desire to
                send anyone up to us. In the meantime, as soon as a hard agreement has been reached, I can send a
                message back through another Escher to that effect, and have teams coming through to work on the New
                Horizon
                very soon after. When it's ready, your people can assemble a team to board the ship and be
                escorted through the Escher to our star system.</p>
            <p class="lead">Thank you Jaren, I will relay all of this to my authorities. We will be in touch.</p>
            <p class="lead">It was very nice to meet you Commander Barnes, he said with a smile in which she detected
                something more than mere friendliness, and which made her feel warm though she did her best to not let
                it
                show.</p>
            <p class="lead">You as well, Jaren.</p>
            <p class="lead">She touched the panel to close the channel, and brought her gloved hands up to grab onto the
                bulkhead in
                front of her as she lowered her head and let out a long sigh.</p>
            <p class="lead">Control? she asked.</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>Yes Commander?</em></p>
            <p class="lead">We don't <em>have</em> nuclear tipped missiles do we?</p>
            <p class="lead"><em>That's classified.</em></p>
            <p class="lead">Kathryn kept her eyes closed as she shook her head. &lsquo;Idiots'</p>
