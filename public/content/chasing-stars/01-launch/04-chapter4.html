                Lightning flashed and a thunderclap rumbled through the building as Markus stepped out of the elevator.
                Rain sheeted
                against the large window at the end of the hall, harder than it had for most of the night so far. It was
                about an
                hour past sunset, and the outline of the city looked eerie under the diffuse light of a full moon behind
                thunder
                clouds.

                He signaled the door chime with his brainchip, and remembered when he'd had his implanted when he was
                twelve. It was
                a routine procedure, at three key points on the skull, a small hole was drilled, and a device the size
                of a grain of
                rice was inserted into the brain. It learned your brain activity patterns and with practice the user
                could operate
                any compatible device, which was pretty much all of them. By now using it felt as natural as reaching
                out with his
                hand to physically push a button.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The door opened, and a chin length black haired twelve-year-old boy with tight features
                greeted him.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Hey Markus," his uncle said with borderline disinterest. He turned around and left the door open for
                him in informal
                invitation to enter.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Lucas and his wife had two children, a younger boy and an older girl. They lived in an expensive suite
                which occupied
                half of the top floor. It was high end but actually somewhat modest given their actual wealth. The
                family owned a
                much larger 'cottage' property in the mountains half an hour away which they retreated to when they felt
                the need
                for more space and air.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Thank you Kaz," Markus offered behind the no longer paying attention pre-teen. He unwrapped his scarf
                and draped it
                over their servant android's outstretched arms, then did the same with his coat. The android had been
                reskinned to
                be a humanoid form basset hound wearing a tuxedo and monocle. It had been his nephew's idea. If Markus
                recalled
                correctly Lucas had made a stupid bet with his son on what was supposed to be a sure thing. It didn't
                seem to be
                moving thought.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Hey Kaz&hellip; what's wrong with the droid?"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Uch, I bricked it trying to install a third-party app into it, it's so stupid. I have to factory reset
                it but I'll
                do it tomorrow."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Well good luck with that&hellip;" The boy was long past listening for a response.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                He found Lucas and his wife in the kitchen as Kazuhiko (or Kaz, as he was called when not in trouble)
                padded off to
                the living room to flop onto the couch and continue watching some streamer on the main screen. Lucas
                only ever
                cooked three things, and their mother's meatballs and red sauce were two of them. Markus had no way to
                tell if it
                matched what their mother would have made, but he did usually enjoy what Lucas prepared. He had limited
                range, but
                did what he did well.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Calling her your girlfriend now are you?" Donna, Lucas' wife asked. She was a thin half Japanese half
                Dutch woman
                about Lucas' height if not a little shorter. He knew her well enough to know she was just teasing.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Not just calling," he considered, "in reality I think."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Well isn't that something," she said as she came over to the table and placed a very full glass of red
                wine in front
                of him before sitting down and taking a long drink from her own. Her long straight black hair shone as
                it danced
                around her shoulders.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Doesn't it get&hellip; weird?" she asked. "I mean you used to rent her right? Maybe I just don't run in
                those circles,
                but wouldn't she resent your having paid for her in the past?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus raised an eyebrow at what she said as he took a drink of the wine. He couldn't tell much about it
                other than
                that it was good; Donna knew her wines. "Well, pretty core to their programming is not resenting being
                purchased."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Programming." Donna said plaintively. "But&hellip; isn't the fact that she probably should be
                resentful, but is
                programmed not to be, well&hellip; kind of problematic?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"I suppose it might be." Markus had never really thought of it that way before. "It's never
                really come up."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Donna seemed to be scrutinizing Markus for a long moment. "That surprises me. That it wouldn't come up
                for you with
                your background." She seemed like she was resisting saying more.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "We all have programming of a sort," Markus offered. "Most of who we are is fixed in our childhood. From
                then on we
                can only really just&hellip; massage the outer layers."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Donna looked at the wine as she rolled the stem back and forth between thumb and fingers. "I think
                people can change
                a lot more than you give them credit for, a lot more deeply than you give them credit for."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Maybe." It was possible. He'd never seen much evidence of it.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Is there some way you can help her with that?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"How do you mean?" He was open to any idea she might have how to help her.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Some way you can unburden her from her&hellip; what did you call it? Her core programming?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "No. Not really. She's not a piece of software you can just&hellip; push updates to." He rolled his hand
                to mime the
                futility. "She has a mind; she has to learn."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"And do you think she can? Learn past her core programming that is?"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "None have yet," was all he could offer. He honestly didn't know enough to have a meaningful opinion on
                the matter.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"So what's the plan then?" she asked sweetly but with a touch of childish mockery. "Marry
                her? Make babies?"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus shrugged, joking along but thinking more seriously as he spoke. "It could be done. I mean a child
                of some
                sort. I could commission a clone; I've always wondered&hellip; well, how things could have been
                different for me. Maybe I
                could have been different."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Could always be worse too, you know&hellip;" Donna answered back, matching his more serious tone as she
                reached for her
                glass.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus had nothing to respond with since he'd never really considered that before. He had daydreamed
                about cloning
                himself to see what could else he could have been like, but never once had he considered that he might
                end up
                something worse. The thought gave him a chill, and the sense of a bottomless cavern.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"<em>Kaz! Suzie! Dinner!!</em>" Markus bellowed out to the rest of the house.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Simulants are a new and changing technology," Markus explained, trying to shift the topic. "But I
                believe that with
                enough time someone like Molly <em>can</em> get past the limitations she was programmed with. From what
                I understand
                simulant brains are fundamentally designed to learn and reprogram themselves. She has a curious spirit
                and a&hellip;
                resolve that I admire. But the amount of time I expect it to take is&hellip; well, longer than I have,"
                he reflected with
                raised eyebrows.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "And is that going to be decades or days?" Donna asked. Markus looked at Lucas as the two children came
                into the room
                and took their seats. "Oh yes, he told me all about it of course. Are you going to go?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"I assume you don't approve?"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Honestly Markus&hellip;" she leaned in to avoid Lucas hearing while his back was turned with final
                preparations for
                dinner. "I'd be happy to see you get involved with anything that gets your motor going again, be it the
                risk of a
                real woman, or the&hellip; potentially single worst mistake of your entire life." She took hold of one
                of his hands. "I
                just want you to feel again, you know?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus considered Donna the sister he never had; the closest to it he ever would have. She and Lucas had
                been
                together almost 20 years, and Donna had been made to watch him go through it all, every toxic
                relationship he had
                until he gave up, every attempt to make something of himself before he inevitably lost interest and gave
                up. At the
                thought he discretely chuckled to himself. At least this he couldn't later change his mind about once
                he'd lost
                interest.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I am thinking about it," he confessed, but then their veil of discretion ended as Lucas began bringing
                dishes of
                food over to the table.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                He looked over at his 17-year-old niece Susan, fully absorbed in her scroll. She was a dork, and he had
                great
                affection and hope for her. She was very studious, but without the sometimes ensuing lack of self-esteem
                which
                sometimes comes along. She was well balanced, and Markus attributed it to a good upbringing. She was
                bright and she
                knew it, but without ego about it; she appreciated that she had gifts and privilege, and felt compelled
                to make
                something of it. Markus remembered feeling that way. He was mostly grateful that her enthusiasm for
                plasma physics
                and business made her the perfect candidate to take over the company when her father retired, saving
                Lucas any such
                potential responsibility.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Kaz was more of a little shit, but also loveable. He was more typical of his age, and just coming into
                that awkward
                age between twelve and forty. He hadn't really displayed any meaningful interests beyond watching game
                streamers and
                sometimes playing them, but he was a good kid who kept out of trouble for the most part. It was clear
                he'd never
                have to work if he didn't want to and could just coast on his family's wealth his whole life, well above
                the
                baseline. He seemed bound for this life now, but people sometimes surprised. Either way Markus was
                hardly in a
                position to judge.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "So you're thinking about going then?" Donna said in mischief as she took a drink and Lucas distributed
                sauce to the
                last plate, which he almost made a mess of at hearing what she said.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Markus gave her a 'you fucking bitch' look and she responded: "Has to be talked about, let's
                have it out."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I haven't gotten to 'think I might go' quite yet," he said dryly, "but I've been thinking a lot about
                what it would
                mean to go, what my life would be like there, what I'd be leaving behind&hellip; that sort of thing."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"so&hellip; thinking about going," Lucas kindly paraphrased for him with some noticeable
                sneer.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "What even is it to you?" he asked and immediately regretted. As he was wont to do, he then
                involuntarily doubled
                down. "How would me going even affect your life at all? Aside from the occasional irritation of me
                needing money
                that is."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Lucas shook his head in disbelief looking at him. "Not affect my life at all?" He seemed genuinely hurt.
                "To lose my
                brother? My only other family? You think that wouldn't affect my life at all?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus was embarrassed. His marginal opinion of himself sometimes forbade him realizing or remembering
                that others
                might have a higher opinion of him.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "But at the same time," Donna interjected. Markus saw her seem to put her hand on his brother's thigh
                under the table
                to pause him. "We want you to be happy, and it's good that you're considering whether this genuinely
                would make you
                happy or not."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Well whether it would or not, it's not exactly a reversible decision." Markus reminded her.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Suzie just then seemed to notice that a conversation was taking place around her. "Wait,
                where are you going?"</p>
            <p class="lead">Donna and Markus laughed. She could be pretty obtuse for how smart she was.</p>
            <p class="lead">"He's not going anywhere," he informed her, but with his conviction seeming to wane.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus explained. "At the gala we went to last night for the new generational star ship mission, I won a
                spot on the
                ship in a raffle."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Sounds more like you <em>lost</em> a raffle," Kaz offered sarcastically.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus looked at him with more admiration of his wit than irritation at his snottiness. "Fair point," he
                offered with
                a pointed fork.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"And you're thinking of going?" Suzie asked with apparent confusion.</p>
            <p class="lead">Markus sighed. But then, remembering his brother's insistence, he merely affirmed. "That's
                right."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "And we'd what, never see you again?" she seemed bothered by this in a way he wasn't expecting. He
                wouldn't have
                thought either of them cared enough for that to bother them much at all, but maybe that was just the
                'nothing
                matters to me' veneer endemic to most youth.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"That's right&hellip;" he'd made himself sad now.</p>
            <p class="lead">"I wouldn't like that," she stated matter-of-factly as she returned her attention to her
                scroll.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Me either," Kaz said without looking up from his plate.</p>
            <p class="lead">Given their age, they were begging him to stay.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                After dinner Markus and Lucas retreated to Lucas' office to smoke a joint. Lucas rarely indulged but
                Markus still
                offered from time to time and occasionally their scheduling aligned. They opened a window and Markus
                looked down
                over the city below as he lit the paper wrap held in his mouth.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"So we should talk about this for real."</p>
            <p class="lead">"un hunh."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I can't imagine you actually going. I just can't, like at all. But you're talking about it enough to
                make me worry
                you might."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus said nothing. He just took another pull and held it while he handed off to his brother before
                finally exhaling
                out the window, the smoke blowing right back into the room with them. Markus let out a slight smile at
                the futility.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Have you even listed the seat for sale? Even thought about how you would go about that or what you
                might get for
                it?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"No&hellip;" Markus admitted, surprising even himself with it.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I can't imagine a world without you." The tenderness and vulnerability of his brother in that moment
                was unexpected.
                It was a side his brother rarely showed him. "But I'm trying to understand, I really am."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Nobody ever left forever in the mid-22<sup>nd</sup> century other than in death. Intercontinental and
                orbital travel
                were routine, and nobody ever did tours longer than 5 or 6 years out in deep space.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Damn it Lucas. You're making me think about how much I'm thinking about going, I don't even know why, I
                really
                don't."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"You've always been&hellip; hungry. Always been hungry for something, but I could never tell
                what."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Me either." Markus admitted with a gentle shrug.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Does this&hellip;" Lucas chuckled to himself over what he'd thought to say next. "Could
                this feed you?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Maybe. I have no idea why or how though." It was the truth.</p>
            <p class="lead">"Well you'd better figure it out real fucking quick, yeah?" Lucas warned him as he passed
                the joint back.</p>
            <p class="lead">He let out a big sigh. "Yeah&hellip;" After a moment he added, "How have the kids been?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Well Kaz&hellip; well to be honest Kaz reminds me a lot of you. Brilliant, but lazy."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus chuckled. It was an unflattering characterization, but not an unfair one. "Whereas Suzie reminds
                me a lot of
                you, studious but no fun."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Lucas shrugged as the joint was passed back to him. "She's doing the right things&hellip; I'm really
                proud of her that
                she's working so hard, that she's already said she wants to become an engineer and work her way up in
                the company,
                but&hellip;"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"So young to be so certain," Markus offered and Lucas nodded as he pulled on the joint.</p>
            <p class="lead">"I mean <em>I</em> never turned away, but there's always a chance that if she focuses too
                long on one thing&hellip;"</p>
            <p class="lead">"She might lose sight of what else could be."</p>
            <p class="lead">"Exactly."</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus took the joint back and turned back to the window as he pulled on the last bit of it a few times
                before
                tossing it out the window and watching the red cherry fall as far as he could make it out. "Maybe I did
                too."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"Come again?"</p>
            <p class="lead">"Maybe <em>I</em> lost sight of what else could be&hellip;"</p>
            <p class="lead">*** *** ***</p>
            <p class="lead">
                "How are you feeling? After last night I mean." Markus asked Molly as he entered their apartment and
                hung up his
                coat. He approached her on the couch and gave her a kiss before sitting down beside her. "You seemed
                pretty rattled
                after last night and then you slept in this morning."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "I'm okay," she offered unconvincingly. "I've just been sitting here all day sifting through memories,
                trying to sort
                out what's mine and what's hers."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "When you seemed to be having trouble last night&hellip;" he rubbed his stubbled chin, trying to
                remember the exact
                phrasing she'd used. "You said something about 'maybe it loses all meaning if you know the outcome. What
                did you
                mean by that?"
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"I'm not sure. It's a paradox I've been trying to resolve all day." She was staring far past
                the far wall.</p>
            <p class="lead">"The ship though, the mission&hellip; why would it lose all meaning if they knew it would be
                a success?" He asked.</p>
            <p class="lead">"It wouldn't remove <em>meaning</em> for them as much as&hellip; I don't now, joy maybe?"
                Molly offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus was quiet as he tried to understand what she was suggesting. "Not joy. Thrill. Knowing the
                outcome takes all
                the <em>thrill</em> out of a gamble. You can be happy you're going to win but there's no rush, no
                elation when you
                do."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Molly nodded knowingly. "I think this maybe explains how you feel."</p>
            <p class="lead">"As though the outcome is known?" Markus laughed. "Haven't quite found out yet how I'm gonna
                die, hon."</p>
            <p class="lead">"No. But you know it will be here. You know what you will and will not have accomplished.
                You already know&hellip;"</p>
            <p class="lead">She seemed lost for how to finish the sentence so Markus finished it for her: "&hellip;the
                final score."</p>
            <p class="lead">Molly snapped her fingers and pointed at him as she nodded in agreement. "Right&hellip;"</p>
            <p class="lead">
                Markus sunk into the couch. How could someone so fundamentally inhuman offer such a profoundly human
                insight. She was
                so right. That was definitely part of it, if not the core of it. He lived his life on autopilot because
                the course
                and path of his life were locked in for him a long time ago, or so he thought. But that ship&hellip;
                that ship was an
                anomaly. It was a disruption, a potential detour if he had it in himself to try to take the wheel once
                again.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">"How do you do it?" he asked</p>
            <p class="lead">"Talent," she said with a misty-eyed smile as she turned to him. She knew what he'd meant.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "Maybe that's why I've been wrapping myself in you&hellip;" he tentatively suggested. "Y<em>our</em>
                future is an open
                book. You're a first of your kind. There is no path for you to follow&hellip; even if you wanted to."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                "And why would I want to if there was?" she asked as she took his hand into both of hers. "It would lose
                all meaning
                wouldn't it? I'd be&hellip;" she paused as something occurred to her so violently she nearly appeared to
                fault, "I'd be
                living someone else's life."
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                With that Molly burst into tears and threw herself into his arms. "And you've had just about enough of
                that, haven't
                you&hellip;" he said as he held her and gently stroked her hair.
