            If you are a potential employer or anyone else checking out my personal site (or anyone else
            interested), my online home for the developer side of my life resides at
            <a href="https://wrosswhite.ca/">wrosswhite.ca</a> and I encourage you to check it out!

            I am a recent graduate of the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program Technical Programming
            option at the British Columbia Institute of technology (BCIT) in Burnaby, BC.

            I'm so excited about what I’ve learned to do and I’m eager to get to it. There are so many
            things which I take for granted now which were so mysterious when I first got started. I’m excited about all
            there still is to learn, there are so many cool technologies out there!
            <br><br>
            I wasn't sure when I applied to the CST program. I knew I was into computers, I’d built my own PC and such,
            and I’d long been quite curious about what went on under the hood. I had a compatible curiosity, but
            couldn't know ahead of time if I'd enjoy the work. Turns out I do!

            It was intimidating and frustrating being a total novice up against people who already knew so
            much in my first term, but by the end of the third term I genuinely felt like I was solidly catching up with
            my peers, not to mention all of those who didn't make it along the way. I am now quite proud to have made it
            all the way through, full course loads all along (no taking courses in the summer to lighten the load for
            me), no fails and when it was all said and done a solid 79 average. All told I’m pretty proud of my
            accomplishment. It took 12 hour days 6 days a week, a lot of hard work, a lot of luck, and a lot of help
            from friends along the way. Now I'm looking forward to my next challenges.

            I am now looking for industry work. I’ve discovered that I have three core areas of interest.
            The first is full stack web development. This is what I gravitate towards when developing personal projects
            at home. It’s more web technologies I’m motivated to learn independently now that school is over. I love
            JavaScript, I like building Node.js projects, and I’m exploring React and REST to broaden that skill set and
            after that I’ll be looking at Docker and python. I’m into both front end and back end. I love making cool
            things work in the browser and being able to show my friends real quick, and I also love being deep in the
            backend, interfacing with APIs, handling requests, and sending the right information back in the right way.
            <br><br>
            But I’m also interested in the .Net Framework and working with C# and Visual Studio to build windows
            applications. I was doing a lot of manual naming when sorting pictures recently and mild frustration was
            enough for me to quickly whip up a Windows renaming application. I love that I can do that now, it’s quite
            empowering. I like Object Oriented Programming and I’d love to get my teeth into larger .Net projects and
            work on new modules for existing systems or help start a new complex system from the beginning.
            <br><br>
            I am also interested in robotics and lower level programming. When I took my C++ class I remember really
            enjoying the language. I liked that you had access to lower level things like pointers but could also do
            higher level things like classes. It felt informal and put together by necessity along the way in a way
            which I also appreciate about JavaScript. I love the idea of working on space technologies, robots, and
            autonomous systems, but high low level skills are required here. I have the ability to become really good at
            these things, and I know I would enjoy it, but my work experience has not yet bent that way.
