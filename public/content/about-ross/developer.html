            I am a graduate of the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program Technical Programming
            option at the British Columbia Institute of technology (BCIT) in Burnaby, BC.

            I'm so excited about what I’ve learned to do and I’m eager to get to it. There are so many
            things which I take for granted now which were so mysterious when I first got started. I’m excited about all
            there still is to learn, there are so many cool technologies out there!
            <br><br>
            I wasn't sure when I applied to the CST program. I knew I was into computers, I’d built my own PC and such,
            and I’d long been quite curious about what went on under the hood. I had a compatible curiosity, but
            couldn't know ahead of time if I'd enjoy the work. Turns out I do!

            It was intimidating and frustrating being a total novice up against people who already knew so
            much in my first term, but by the end of the third term I genuinely felt like I was solidly catching up with
            my peers, not to mention all of those who didn't make it along the way. I am now quite proud to have made it
            all the way through, full course loads all along (no taking courses in the summer to lighten the load for
            me), no fails and when it was all said and done a solid 79 average. All told I’m pretty proud of my
            accomplishment. It took 12 hour days 6 days a week, a lot of hard work, a lot of luck, and a lot of help
            from friends along the way. Now I'm looking forward to my next challenges.

            I currently work at AlayaCare as a full stack developer.  I have been with them almost two years now, and
            have been promoted from associate developer to regular (intermediate) developer.  It's a great company to
            work for, and they make it easy to want to stay.  I lost hope a few months into the 2020 lockdowns and stopped
            looking for work, then a couple months later they contacted me and asked if I was still looking for work.  I
            work out of their Victoria office on the currently in development residential care home management software 
            finance section, and their flexible work policy means that I'll never have to quit due to being recalled to the
            office.  I work with C#/.NET, typescript, SQL, and AngularJS (I know, but we're moving to Vue).  I have worked on
            their migration to microservices efforts, and hope to return to that soon, it's interesting and stimulating
            modern development work.

            While I'm not actively looking for work, and AlayaCare is a great company to work for, everybody has their 
            price...  If you are a prospective employer checking me out, greetings! Feel free to look around.  Although
            you've probably seen them already, you can find my cover letter and resume below.
