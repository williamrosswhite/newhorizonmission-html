            As I was graduating from my bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan,
            with a major in psychology, a minor in philosophy, and having taken pretty much every first year science
            course, I started working on a literary project which was part work of fiction, part existential treatise,
            part trying to explain everything I have come to understand about life, the universe, and everything.
            <br><br>
            These books are works I am incredibly proud of, but they have gone through a process.  The original trilogy 
            of books are artefacts of another time in my life, and I am currently hard at work updating them into a 
            complete revised six part series.  The originals reveal much about me, at times perhaps too much,
            and my thoughts and views (and willingess to expose myself in that way) have changed over time. These books
            have once again become my primary creative focus and I'm excited to be working on them again.  I have 
            removed them from being for sale online, and am instead making them available here on this website to anyone
            who would like to keep up with my work and maybe even offer some feedback as I develop them further.
            <br><br>
            I think them being in this format is cool, that they can be read like on an e-reader in any browser.  That 
            being said, if you'd like to read any of these and specifically would like them in a particular file type
            feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to provide it to you.

            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything in reality trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.

            Markus Bowland is a dipshit fail son.  Wealthy and talented, he has squandered every opportunity 
            anyone could ever hope for.  Emotionally crippled at a young age by a tragic loss, the expectations on him
            left him unwilling to try, unwilling to put himself in a position to fail in any way.  Working a dead end
            job, keeping his wealth secret from his peers and mooching off of his sucessful brother when necessary, he 
            is afraid to even have a relationship with a human woman, preferring his favourite simulant prostitute 
            instead.

        <p class="lead">
            Largely just to annoy his brother, he enters a lottery to win a spot on the New Horizon generational
            starship.  When he wins the spot and learns more about the mission and the people behind it, he finds 
            himself strangely unwilling to sell the seat.  He starts considering going himself without understanding 
            why, and begins to dare seeking out real meaning in his life for the first time, and asking why he's 
            resisted it so hard for so long.

            More than two centuries into the future, the New Horizon generational starship is halfway 
            through its long journey towards the planet Haven.. It is the last great project of humanity, but 
            after eighty long years the journey is still only half over. The last person to have known Earth died
            a long time ago, and new ship borne generations are having to suffer the existential nightmare of a 
            complete and total absence of choice in their lives. A horrific event starts unravelling their small 
            and seemingly harmonious society, threatening the mission, and their livesâ€¦

            Midway flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the
            journey, the crew who grew up on the small ship, and who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and
            suffer this existence for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own
            dreams. From maximum privilige, to none at all.

            The long wait is over. After a century and a half, the New Horizon Generational Starship has finally 
            arrived at its destination and the planet seems to be everything the crew could have hoped for. Four 
            simulants of the mission&apos;s original founders wake up after their long sleep to discover a dangerously 
            factionalized crew, and the animosity and hatred amongst the crew threaten to destroy the mission 
            before its dream can be triumphantly realized.

            Arrival is the third book, and is about what happens when the New Horizon finally arrives at Haven.  
            Simulants of the original mission founders wake up excited, expecting to help establish a toehold on 
            the new planet, but instead find themselves mediating a embittered conflict amongst the crew. One 
            faction takes drastic action and the results leave not only the mission's ultimate success in peril, 
            but the lives of everyone who travelled so far...

            Much like Midway, Arrival is complete and in a polished state, it has become somewhat 
            dated.  I believe it requires very little revision, but I'm sure it will benefit from another pass 
            of editing.  This was really the first book I self consciously wrote for the reader, just trying to 
            tell a compelling story well with far less self indulgence.  It was so gratifying to finally get here,
            and to appreciate the scope of the journey through the founder simulants, and finally be able to tell 
            their own story.  I hope you enjoy it too.

            Reunion is the fourth book in the overall series, but also the first in a sequel trilogy.  It is about
            the descendants of the Haven colony 500 years hence, and begins on the day that they have first been able 
            to return to the long abandoned New Horizon in orbit, a powerful reminder of where they come from, and the 
            powerful symbol of their destiny to return.

            This book is about at a third draft stage.  I am actively editing this book to reacquaint myself with this 
            world in preperation for finally completing the fifth book.  I am both please and dismayed at my ability to 
            so dramatically improve upon material I wrote so recently.  It's like I told my manager at AlayaCare when I 
            started, I start slow, but I accelerate quickly.  I will endeavour to reflect my editing updates 
            here as I progress.  If you have any thoughts on it as I go, I'd love to hear them!  I am currently through 
            chapter 8 in my edit.

            This book is currently only about two thirds complete.  I abandoned it when I stopped writing for a while between
            running out of steam and being demoralized over the reception of my first books.  I have a reneweds spirit and
            am finally willing to kill all my darlings.  I'm eager to complete this book after an edit of Reunion to get the
            juices flowing again and reconnect with these characters.

            I have conceived the final book but I have yet to birth it.  I know its heart and shape, but I haven't written a
            word yet.  Stay tuned, it will be an exciting and satisfying conclusion, but I'm not ready to give anything away.
            I am so incredibly excited to get my ideas out.  I also at some point plan to take another crack at these titles.
            The one word titles worked really well initially, but 'Contact' and 'Resurrection'?  Come on, I can do better.

            If you absolutely, positively must, I will also make the original novel Launch available.  Please don't read it.
            If you've read everythign else I've written and want more, read it.  If you want to compare how abysmal my writing
            was to how improved it is now, sure.  If you are specifically looking for a navel gazing, thinly veiled 
            auto-biographical existential master's thesis written entirely for me and not for you?  By all means read it.
            If you enjoy page after page of endless digressions explaining things I think are cool and how I would solve the 
            world if it would let me?  Well hey, if that's you you might love it.  If it's not, do us both a favour and just
