            As I was graduating from my bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan,
            with a major in psychology, a minor in philosophy, and having taken pretty much every first year science
            course, I started working on a literary project which was part work of fiction, part existential treatise,
            part trying to explain everything I have come to understand about life, the universe, and everything.
            <br><br>
            These books are works I am incredibly proud of, but they are artefacts of another time in my life, as well
            as a passion I plan to return to later on in my life. They reveal much about me, at times perhaps too much,
            and my thoughts and views change over time. These books are not the current focus of my life, and not
            something I am actively pushing, but I write them, they do exist, and they are available for whoever may
            care to take an interest in them.

            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything actually trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.

            Launch, the first book, is about a man who grew up with maximum privilege and able to do
            anything with his life, but feels a profound ambivalence which comes from a lack of a driving force in his
            life. Applying to the New Horizons program effectively on a whim, he wins a spot and has to come to
            understand why he finds himself wanting to go, and walk away from his terrestrial obligations to surrender
            all his privilige, and die in deep space for a dream he'll never personally see realized.

            Midway, the second book, flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the
            journey, the crew who grew up on the small ship, and who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and
            suffer this existence for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own
            dreams. From maximum privilige, to none at all.
            <br><br>
            Despite careful social engineering, humanity bleeds through, and the gruesome first murder ever on
            the ship launches an investigation which unravels a plot by an original crewmember to undermine the core
            mission and find some way, any way, to construct a shred of authentic personally driven meaning in their
            lives, no matter what the costs.

            Arrival, the second book, is about what happens when they ultimately arrive. Simulants of the
            original mission founders wake up expecting to help establish a toehold on the new planet, but find
            themselves instead mediating bitter conflicts amongst the crew. One faction takes drastic action and the
            results leave not only the mission's ultimate success in peril, but the lives of everyone who travelled so
            far...

            Reunion, the fourth book in the series, but also the first in a planned sequel trilogy, is about
            the descendants of the colony 500 years hence, and the day a ship from another colony arrives with
            impressive yet frighteningly powerful technologies, and offeres them the chance to return to Earth and have
            the chance to solve the greatest mystery on multiple planets. Why did Earth go dark and cease all
            communications 500 years ago.
