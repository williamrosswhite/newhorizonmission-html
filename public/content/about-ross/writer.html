        <p class="lead">
            As I was graduating from my bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan with a major 
            in psychology, a minor in philosophy, and having taken pretty much every first year science course, I 
            started working on a literary project which was part work of fiction, part existential treatise, part trying 
            to explain everything I had come to understand about life, the universe, and everything.
            <br><br>
            These books are works I am incredibly proud of, but they have gone through a process. &nbsp;The original trilogy 
            of books are artefacts of another time in my life, and I am currently hard at work updating them into a 
            complete revised six part series. &nbsp;The originals reveal much about me, at times perhaps too much, and my 
            thoughts and views (and willingess to expose myself in that way) have changed over time. These books have 
            once again become my primary creative focus and I'm excited to be working on them again. &nbsp;I have removed 
            them from being for sale online, and am instead making them available here on this website to anyone
            who would like to keep up with my work and maybe even offer some feedback as I develop them further.
            <br><br>
            I think them being in this format is cool; I like that they can easily be read like an e-reader in any browser. &nbsp;
            That being said, if you'd like to read any of these and specifically would like them in a particular file type
            feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to provide it to you.

        <h2>New Horizons</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through of how it could 
            all work out despite everything in reality trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump). &nbsp;It's set in Vancouver 
            150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150 year journey to a distant 
            neighbouring star.

        <h2>Book 1: Chasing Stars</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            Markus Bowland is a dipshit fail son. &nbsp;Wealthy and talented, he has squandered every opportunity 
            anyone else could have ever hope for. &nbsp;Emotionally crippled at a young age by a tragic loss, the expectations 
            on him left him unwilling to try, unwilling to put himself in a position to fail in any way. &nbsp;Working a dead 
            end job, keeping his wealth secret from his peers, and mooching off of his sucessful brother when necessary, 
            he is afraid to even have a relationship with a human woman, preferring instead his favourite simulant prostitute.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Largely just to annoy his brother, he enters a lottery to win a spot on the New Horizon generational
            starship. &nbsp;When he wins the spot and learns more about the mission and the vision of the people behind it, he 
            finds himself strangely unwilling to sell the seat. &nbsp;He starts seriously considering going himself without 
            understanding why, and begins to dare seeking out real meaning in his life for the first time, and asking why 
            he's resisted it so hard for so long.

        <h2>Book 2: Midway</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            More than two centuries into the future, the New Horizon generational starship is halfway 
            through its long journey towards the planet Haven. &nbsp;It is the last great project of humanity, but 
            after eighty long years the journey is still only half over. The last person to have known Earth has 
            died and new ship borne generations are having to suffer the existential nightmare of a complete and 
            total absence of choice in their lives. &nbsp;A horrific event starts unravelling their small and 
            seemingly harmonious society, threatening the mission, and their livesâ€¦
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Midway flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the journey, the crew who grew 
            up on the small ship, who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and must suffer this existence 
            for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own. &nbsp;Mission founders 
            with maximum privilege have cursed them by leaving them with none.

        <h2>Book 3: Arrival</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            The long wait is over. After a century and a half, the New Horizon Generational Starship has finally 
            arrived at its destination and the planet seems to be everything the crew could have hoped for. Four 
            simulants of the mission&apos;s original founders wake up after their long sleep to discover a dangerously 
            factionalized crew, with the animosity and hatred amongst the crew threatening to destroy the mission 
            before its dream can be triumphantly realized.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Arrival is the third book and is about what happens when the New Horizon finally arrives at Haven. &nbsp;
            Simulants of the original mission founders wake up excited, expecting to help establish a toehold on 
            the new planet, but instead find themselves mediating a embittered conflict amongst the crew. One 
            faction takes drastic action and the results leave not only the mission's ultimate success in peril, 
            but the lives of everyone who travelled so far as well...
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Much like Midway, Arrival is complete and in a polished state, but it has become somewhat dated. &nbsp;I 
            believe it requires some revision and will benefit from another pass of editing. &nbsp;This was really the 
            first book I self consciously wrote for the reader, just trying to tell a compelling story well with 
            far less self indulgence. &nbsp;It was so gratifying to finally get here, and to appreciate the scope of 
            the journey through the founder simulants and finally be able to tell their own story. &nbsp;I hope you 
            enjoy it too.

            Reunion is the fourth book in the overall series, but also the first in a sequel trilogy. &nbsp;It is about
            the descendants of the Haven colony 500 years hence, and begins on the day they are first able to return 
            to the long abandoned New Horizon in orbit. &nbsp;It has served as a powerful reminder of where they come from, 
            and their destiny to return.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Just as Commander Kathryn Barnes steps foot on the ancient ship, humans from another colony make 
            first contact witht them with an intriguing but suspicious propsition. &nbsp;They clam friendly intent, but their 
            technology is frighteningly advanced to theirs by comparison. &nbsp;They learn of a network of rifts they have 
            developed which may enable them to investigate the greatest mystery on multiple planets: what happened to Earth?
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            This book is complete and I have recently completed an edit of it in preparation for finishing the fifth book. &nbsp;
            I have been both pleased and dismayed at my ability to so dramatically improve upon material I wrote so recently!  
            It's like I told my manager at AlayaCare when I started: I start slow, but I accelerate quickly.

            Contact takes place fifteen or so years later when the first drone ship sent to a non conlony system makes
            first contact with them back home, allowing an expedition through the rift to a new system for the first time. &nbsp;
            Kathryn is tasked with captaining the newly constructed New Horizons II through the rift to explore the new 
            system. &nbsp;They have their first encounter with non human intelligent life, and find themseves thrown in the middle 
            of a galactic civil war, needing to pick based on too little information before they are destroyed.
            <br><br>
            This book is currently only about two thirds complete. &nbsp;I abandoned it when I stopped writing for a while between
            running out of steam and being demoralized over the reception of my first books. &nbsp;I am currently editing what I have 
            already written and am excited to finish this story!  I have currently edited through Chapter 16 and you can follow

            I am so incredibly excited to get my ideas out but have to finish Contact first. &nbsp;I also at some point plan to take 
            another crack at these titles. &nbsp;I felt the one word titles worked really well initially, but 'Contact' and 
            'Resurrection'?  Come on, I can do better.
