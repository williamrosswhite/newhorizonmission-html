            As I was graduating from my bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan,
            with a major in psychology, a minor in philosophy, and having taken pretty much every first year science
            course, I started working on a literary project which was part work of fiction, part existential treatise,
            part trying to explain everything I have come to understand about life, the universe, and everything.
            <br><br>
            These books are works I am incredibly proud of, but they have gone through a process.  The original trilogy 
            of books are artefacts of another time in my life, and I am currently hard at work updating them into a 
            complete revised six part series.  The originals reveal much about me, at times perhaps too much,
            and my thoughts and views (and willingess to expose myself in that way) have changed over time. These books
            have once again become my primary creative focus and I'm excited to be working on them again.  I have 
            removed them from being for sale online, and am instead making them available here on this website to anyone
            who would like to keep up with my work and maybe even offer some feedback as I develop them further.
            <br><br>
            I think them being in this format is cool, that they can be read like on an e-reader in any browser.  That 
            being said, if you'd like to read any of these and specifically would like them in a particular file type
            feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to provide it to you.

            The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything in reality trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.

            'Chasing Stars', a page one rewrite of the original book 'Launch', the first book, is about a man who grew 
            up with maximum privilege and able to do anything with his life, but feels a profound ambivalence stemming 
            from a lack of an inherent driving force in his life. Serendipitously winning a spot in the New Horizons 
            program effectively on a whim, he has to come to understand why he finds himself unexpectedly wanting to 
            go, and understand what is and has always been holding him back from becoming more.

            Midway flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the
            journey, the crew who grew up on the small ship, and who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and
            suffer this existence for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own
            dreams. From maximum privilige, to none at all.
            <br><br>
            Despite careful social engineering, humanity inevitably bleeds through, and the gruesome first ever murder on
            the ship launches an investigation which unravels a plot by an original crewmember to undermine the core
            mission and find some way, <i>any</i> way, to construct one shred of authentic personally driven meaning in their
            lives no matter the cost.

            In Arrival, the New Horizon finally arrives at the planet Haven.  Simulants of the original mission founders 
            wake up expecting to help establish a toehold on the new planet, but instead find themselves mediating bitter 
            conflicts amongst the crew. One faction takes drastic action and the results leave not only the mission's

            Reunion is the fourth book in the series, but also the first in a planned sequel trilogy.  It is about
            the descendants of the Haven colony 500 years hence, and begins on the day a ship from another colony 
            arrives with impressive yet frighteningly powerful technologies.  It offeres them the chance to return 
            to Earth and solve the greatest mystery on multiple planets.  Why did Earth go dark and cease all
            contact 500 years ago?

            This book is currently only about two thirds complete.  I abandoned it when I stopped writing for a while between
            running out of steam and being demoralized over the reception of my first books.  I have a reneweds spirit and
            am finally willing to kill all my darlings.  I'm eager to complete this book after an edit of Reunion to get the
            juices flowing again and reconnect with these characters.

            I have conceived the final book but I have yet to birth it.  I know its heart and shape, but I haven't written a
            word yet.  Stay tuned, it will be an exciting and satisfying conclusion, but I'm not ready to give anything away.
            I am so incredibly excited to get my ideas out.  I also at some point plan to take another crack at these titles.
            The one word titles worked really well initially, but 'Contact' and 'Resurrection'?  Come on, I can do better.

            If you absolutely, positively must, I will also make the original novel Launch available.  Please don't read it.
            If you've read everythign else I've written and want more, read it.  If you want to compare how abysmal my writing
            was to how improved it is now, sure.  If you are specifically looking for a navel gazing, thinly veiled 
            auto-biographical existential master's thesis written entirely for me and not for you?  By all means read it.
            If you enjoy page after page of endless digressions explaining things I think are cool and how I would solve the 
            world if it would let me?  Well hey, if that's you you might love it.  If it's not, do us both a favour and just 
            don't.
